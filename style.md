# Style Guide

These are some notes for me and contributors on some style choice specific to this book.

## Plots

Import `dmol` package. It will set-up the style for all plots.

## Citations

The goal of this book is instructional and not a comprehensive review of the literature.
Citations should be added as needed for explaining concepts and justifying statements. Citations
should be added as:

<pre>
This is a citation{cite}`foo2020`.
</pre>

## Links to Other Resources

Some topics are already covered well in other books and do not need to be repeated here.
These should be linked and it is clear what can be found in that resource. For example:

<pre>
You can find more details on canonicalization of SMILES strings [in this online article](https://example.org)
</pre>

## Tips and Warnings

Tips (bordered boxes in text) should be used sparingly to convey critical
notes beyond bolding. Examples include shuffling data, not using testing data
for validation, etc. A warning is a possible mistake or pitfall. A tip is an important
thing to remember and not necessarily a potential mistake.

## Right-column Notes

Notes on the right column are meant to be extra information that adds
context, reminders, or additional details about the main text. It should not
be necessary to read these for understanding the main text. Should be equivalent to footnotes in-text.
