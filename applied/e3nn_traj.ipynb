    "# Equivariant Neural Network for Predicting Trajectories\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Understand the importance of equivariance and how to check for equivariances in your model\n",
    "  * Understand how an equivariant model can be implemented in E3NN \n",

    "In this example, we will train an equivariant neural network to predict the next frame in the trajectory alignment example in {doc}`../dl/data`. As stated in {doc}`../dl/data`, for time-dependent trajectories, we do not need to concern ourselves with permutation equivariance because it is implied that the order of the points does not change. Thus, we can treat this example as point cloud, meaning that any deep learning model that we train on this data should have rotation and translation equivariance. In other words, our model should be E(3) equivariant. [E3NN](https://e3nn.org) is a library built to create equivariant neural networks for the this group, so it's a great choice for this problem {cite}`geiger2022e3nn`. We will look at E3NN in more detail later in the chapter."

    "## E3NN Basics\n",
    "E3NN is a library for creating equivariant neural networks, specifically in E(3). E3NN is built for spatial equvariance in 3-D space, giving us equivariance with respect to the E(3) group of rotations, inversions, and translations. As discussed before, the time-dependent trajectory points do not change order, so we do not need to worry about permutation equivariance/invariance in this case; we only need E(3)-equivariance. E3NN is a great tool for this problem because we have 3-dimensional points in space, and if we transform them in space, we want the output to transform the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "E3NN works through the use of irreducible representations (irreps). In general, representations tell you how to interact with the data with repect to the group, and irreducible representations are the smallest and complete representations. When creating a model, we give the model the irreps so that it knows how to handle the data we will give it during trianing. It's not necessary to understand what the irreps are; instead, just know that they are the smallest representations, which are similar to, and transform the same way as, the spherical harmonics. If you do want more information, you can read about irreps [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09453). Any (reducible) representation can be decomposed into irreducible representations. If you want to know more, you can check out more on the E3NN documentation website [@e3nn]. Let's take a look at how the irreps are used in this context. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this group (O(3), which includes parity), we need to find the L and d for each piece of data, where $d = 2L + 1$ (d = dimension). Look at the table below. \n",
    "\n",
    "| **parity** | **L** | **d** | **name**      |\n",
    "|------------|-------|-------|---------------|\n",
    "| even       | 0     | 1     | scalar        |\n",
    "| odd        | 0     | 1     | pseudo scalar |\n",
    "| even       | 1     | 3     | pseudo vector |\n",
    "| odd        | 1     | 3     | vector        |\n",
    "| even       | 2     | 5     |       -       |\n",
    "| odd        | 2     | 5     |       -       |\n",
    "\n",
    "The general notation is **MxLp**, where M is the number of 3-D coordinate per input, L is the L (spherical harmonic) from the table above, and p corresponds to the parity (e: even, o: odd). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you wanted to portray \"12 scalars, 4 vectors\" in this format, you would write `12x0e + 4x1o`. Take a minute to make sure you understand how to use this notation, as it's essential for E3NN. E3NN deals with equivariance by receiving the irreps as a model parameter. This allows the E3NN framework to know how each input feature/output transforms under symmetry, so that it can treat each piece appropriately. As a side note, the output of an E3NN model must always be of equal or higher symmetry than your input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because E3NN is built to handle 3D spatial data, we do not need to tell the model that we are going to give it 3D coordinates; it's implicit and **required**. The irreps_in, instead, correspond to the input node features. In this example, we don't have input features, but as an example, you can imagine we could want our model to predict the next set of coordinates, given the intitial coordinates and the corresponding atom types. In that case, our irreps_in would be the atom types (one scalar per input if we have one-hot vectors)."

However, since we are trying to predict 12 vectors out for 12 vectors in, we only need to tell the model to predict 1 vector per input `1x1o`. Take a minute to make sure you understand why this is the case. You can think of the model recognizing 12 input vectors and predicting a vector for each. Again, E3NN expects coordinate inputs, so we don't specify this for the input."

We specify that our nodes have no attributes, and that we want to use spherical harmonics as our edge attributes. You don't need to be too concerned with the `number_of_basis`, `radial_layers`, or `radial_neurons`, as they don't change much between applications. The `max_radius` and `num_neighbors` are intuitive, just specify the average numbers in your max radius (a hyperparameter). If you do not know this, you can write a function that calculates an average number of neighbors. Lastly, the `num_nodes` is not important in this case since we set `reduce_output` to `False`. If we set this to `True`, that means we want to reduce our output over all `num_nodes` in our input to get a single scalar as an output. \n",
