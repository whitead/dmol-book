    "This chapter builds on the model and information presented in {doc}`../dl/NLP`. We'll see how to develop, train, and deploy a model to a website. The goal is to develop a model that can propose new molecules. A \"molecule\" is a broad term, so we'll restrict ourselves to molecules like those that might be used for a small molecule drug. There is an existing database for this task called [ZINC](http://zinc15.docking.org/) (recursive acronym: *ZINC is not commercial*). The ZINC database contains 750 million molecules (as SMILES) that **can be purchased directly**. By training with ZINC, you are restricting your training distribution to molecules that can be synthesized.{cite}`sterling2015zinc`\n",
    "\n",
    "750 million molecules is often enough. Instead of generating new molecules with a model, you can just sample from ZINC and be assured that each molecule is purchasable. Sometimes that is not possible because we're more interested in building a representation (a vector for each molecule), rather than actually sampling like in self-supervised learning. My recommendation in projects is to strongly consider just using ZINC directly if possible. We'll continue on for our approach, because we may go on to use the RNN for \"downstream tasks\" like predicting solubility using the self-supervised trained RNN.\n",

    "At first, it may seem simple to generate new molecules. Any sequence of SELFIES is a valid molecule {cite}`krenn2020self`. Let's start by trying this approach -- making random sequences. Recall that a sequence is an array of tokens, like characters or words. In SELFIES, the tokens are very clear because they are enclosed by square brackets. For example,`[C][C]` is a SELFIES sequence with two tokens. \n",

    "## Approach 2: Token RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next approach will be to use a recurrent neural network as we did in {doc}`../dl/NLP`. We will make one major change. The RNN will be trained to predict a whole sequence instead of one value (like solubility). This training process is called self-supervised. We create labels, from splitting up the training data, so it is not exactly unsupervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we implement self-supervised training with an RNN is that we feed it a sequence up to position $i-1$ and then ask it to predict the sequence value at position $i$. Then at inference time, we feed its output at $i - 1$ as the input to $i$. There are a few tricks to make this efficient. The first is that if we split our data into all possible pairs of training labels (sequence up to $i - 1$) and labels (value at $i$), we'll have $N\\times L$ examples which in our case is about 100 million. To treat this, we'll consider the predicted label to be the whole sequence $\\vec{\\hat{y}}$  and that will include each individual prediction challenge. For example, predicting $\\hat{y}$ given $x_0, x_1, x_2$ will be the value of $\\vec{\\hat{y}}$ at index 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice there is a bit of a length mismatch with this approach. What would $\\hat{y}_0$ correspond to? You might say it is the predicted label without any input features, but RNNs require an input to have an output. Instead, we'll prefix every sequence with the special `[nop]` token which means do nothing. Then $\\hat{0}$ will be the prediction given a `[nop]` token. We just need to remember at inference time we need to always begin with the `[nop]` token to match the training conditions. "
