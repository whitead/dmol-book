    "We have seen two chapters about equivariances in {doc}`data` and {doc}`Equivariant`. We have seen one chapter on dealing with molecules as objects with permutation equivariance {doc}`gnn`. We will combine these ideas and create neural networks that can treat arbitrary molecules with point clouds and permutation equivariance. We already saw SchNet is able to do this by working with an invariant point cloud representation (distance to atoms), but modern networks mix in ideas from {doc}`Equivariant` along with graph neural networks (GNN). This is a highly-active research area, especially for predicting energies, forces, and relaxed structures of molecules.\n",

We also know that graph neural networks (GNNs) have permutation equivariance and, with the correct choice of edge features, rotation and translation invariance. So why go beyond GNNs?\n",

Look at the {numref}`decaline-bicylopentyl` below and think about the degree and neighbors of the atoms near the mixing of the rings -- you'll see if you try to use message passing the two molecules are identical.

    "These are arguments for using Cartesian coordinates in addition to a GNN, but why use equivariant neural networks? Most molnet research is for **neural potentials**.

Models like SchNet or ANI are invariant and are not as accurate as models like NequiP or TorchMD-NET that have equivariances in their internal layers. Another reason is that there are indeed specific 3D configurations that should have different energies (according to quantum chemistry calculations), but are invariant if treatd with pairwise distance alone {cite}`pozdnyakov2022incompleteness`."

    "## The Elements of Modern Molecular NNs\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a flurry of ideas about molents in the last few years, especially with the advances in equivariant neural network layers. Batatia et al.{cite}`batatia2022design` have proposed a categorization of the main elements of molnets (which they call E(3)-equivariant NNs) that I will adopt here. They categorize the decisions to be made into three parts of the architecture: the atomic cluster expansions (ACE), the body-order of the messages, and the architecture of the message passing neural network (MPNN). This categorization might also be viewed within the GNN theory as node features (ACE), message creation and aggregation (body-order), and node update (MPNN details). See {doc}`gnn` for more details on MPNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a relatively new categorization and certainly is not necessary to use. Most papers do not use this categorization and it takes some effort to put models into it. The benefit of thinking about models with this abstractions is it helps us differentiate between the very large number of models now being pursued in the literature. There is also a bit of chaos in teasing out what *differentiates* the best models from others. For example, it took a while to discover that the most important features in NequIP were data normalization and how atom embeddings are treated {cite}`batatia2022design`. This categorization is also improving how these models are designed."

As we pass through GNN layers the features will become larger. The atoms are the nodes. The atom features need to be organized a bit differently than previously because some of the features should be invariant with respect to the group --- SO(3) --- and some need to be equivariant. "
