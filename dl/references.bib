  abstract = {{Protein solubility plays a vital role in pharmaceutical research and production yield. For a given protein, the extent of its solubility can represent the quality of its function, and is ultimately defined by its sequence. Thus, it is imperative to develop novel, highly accurate in silico sequence-based protein solubility predictors. In this work we propose, DeepSol, a novel Deep Learning-based protein solubility predictor. The backbone of our framework is a convolutional neural network that exploits k-mer structure and additional sequence and structural features extracted from the protein sequence.DeepSol outperformed all known sequence-based state-of-the-art solubility prediction methods and attained an accuracy of 0.77 and Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.55. The superior prediction accuracy of DeepSol allows to screen for sequences with enhanced production capacity and can more reliably predict solubility of novel proteins.DeepSol’s best performing models and results are publicly deposited at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1162886 (Khurana and Mall, 2018).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

Previous work with an autonomous lane following system, ALVINN (Pomerleau, 1993), has yielded good results in uncluttered conditions. This paper presents an artificial neural network based learning approach for handling difficult scenes which will confuse the ALVINN system. This work presents a mechanism for achieving task-specific focus of attention by exploiting temporal coherence. A saliency map, which is based upon a computed expectation of the contents of the inputs in the next time step, indicates which regions of the input retina are important for performing the task. The saliency map can be used to accentuate the features which are important for the task, and de-emphasize those which are not.}

  journal   = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
  abstract  = {The discovery of novel materials and functional molecules can help to solve some of society’s most urgent challenges, ranging from efficient energy harvesting and storage to uncovering novel pharmaceutical drug candidates. Traditionally matter engineering–generally denoted as inverse design–was based massively on human intuition and high-throughput virtual screening. The last few years have seen the emergence of significant interest in computer-inspired designs based on evolutionary or deep learning methods. The major challenge here is that the standard strings molecular representation SMILES shows substantial weaknesses in that task because large fractions of strings do not correspond to valid molecules. Here, we solve this problem at a fundamental level and introduce SELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings), a string-based representation of molecules which is 100% robust. Every SELFIES string corresponds to a valid molecule, and SELFIES can represent every molecule. SELFIES can be directly applied in arbitrary machine learning models without the adaptation of the models; each of the generated molecule candidates is valid. In our experiments, the model’s internal memory stores two orders of magnitude more diverse molecules than a similar test with SMILES. Furthermore, as all molecules are valid, it allows for explanation and interpretation of the internal working of the generative models.}
