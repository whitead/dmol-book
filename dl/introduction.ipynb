    "\n",
    "**Deep learning** is a category of **machine learning**. Machine learning is a category of **artificial intelligence**. Deep learning is the use of neural networks to do machine learning, like classify and regress data. This chapter provides an overview and we will dive further into these topics in later chapters.\n",

    "There are many good resources on deep learning to supplement these chapters. The goal of this book is to present a chemistry and materials-first introduction to deep learning. These other resources can help provide better depth in certain topics and cover topics we do not even cover, because I do not find them relevant to deep learning (e.g., image processing). I found the introduction the from [Ian Goodfellow's book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html) to be a good intro. If you're more visually oriented, Grant Sanderson has made a [short video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) specifically about neural networks that give an applied introduction to the topic. DeepMind has a high-level video showing what can be accomplished with [deep learning & AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R52wiUgxZI). When people write \"deep learning is a powerful tool\" in their research papers, they typically cite [this Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539) by Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffery Hinton. Zhang, Lipton, Li, and Smola have written a practical and example-driven [online book](http://d2l.ai/index.html) that gives each example in Tensorflow, PyTorch, and MXNet. You can find many chemistry-specific examples and information about deep learning in chemistry via the excellent [DeepChem](https://deepchem.io/) project. \n",

    "The main advice I would give to beginners in deep learning are to focus less on the neurological inspired language (i.e., connections between neurons), and instead view deep learning as a series of linear algebra operations where many of the matrices are filled with adjustable parameters. There are of course a few non-linear functions (activations) here and there, but deep learning is essentially linear algebra operations specified via a \"computation network\" (aka computation graph) that vaguely looks like neurons connected in a brain.\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is a neural network?\n",
    "\n",
    "The *deep* in deep learning means we have many layers in our neural networks. What is a neural network? Without loss of generality, we can view neural networks as 2 components: (1) a non-linear function $g(\\cdot)$ which operates on our input features $\\mathbf{X}$ and outputs a new set of features $\\mathbf{H} = g(\\mathbf{X})$ and (2) a linear model like we saw in our {doc}`../ml/introduction`. Our model equation for deep learning regression is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "   \\hat{y} = \\vec{w}g(\\vec{x}) + b\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main discussion points in our ML chapters was how arcane and difficult it is to choose features. Here, we have replaced our features with a set of trainable features $g(\\vec{x})$ and then use the same linear model as before. So how do we design $g(\\vec{x})$? That is the deep learning part. $g(\\vec{x})$ is a differentiable function composed of **layers**, which are themselves differentiable functions each with trainable weights (free variables). Deep learning is a mature field and there is a set of standard layers, each with a different purpose. For example, convolution layers look at a fixed neighborhood around each element of an input tensor. Dropout layers randomly inactivate inputs as a form of regularization. The most commonly used and basic layer is the **dense** or **fully-connected** layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "Dense means each input element affects each output element. At one point, sparse layers were popular and had a nice analogy with how a brain is connected. However, dense layers do not require deciding which input/output connections to make and sparse layers are very rare now (except incidentally sparse layers, like convolutions).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A dense layer is defined by two things: the desired output feature shape and the **activation**. The equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "     \\vec{h} = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}\\vec{x} + \\vec{b})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{W}$ is a trainable $D \\times F$ matrix, where $D$ is the input vector ($\\vec{x}$) dimension and $F$ is the output vector ($\\vec{h}$) dimension, $\\vec{b}$ is a trainable $F$ dimensional vector, and $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ is the activation function. $F$ is an example of a **hyperparameter**, it is not trainable but is a problem dependent choice. $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ is another hyperparameter. In principle, any differentiable function that has a range of $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ can be used for activation. However, just a few activations have been empirically designed that balance computational cost and effectiveness. One example we've seen before is the sigmoid. Another is a hyperbolic tangent, which behaves similar (domain/range) to the sigmoid. The most commonly used activation is the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which is \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma(x) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{lr}\n",
    "x & x > 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & \\textrm{otherwise}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Universal Approximation Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that neural networks are a good choice at approximating unknown functions ($f(\\vec{x})$) is that a neural network can approximate any function with a large enough network depth (number of layers) or width (size of hidden layers). There are many variations of this theorem -- infinitely wide or infinitely deep neural networks. For example, any 1 dimensional function can be approximated by a depth 5 neural network with ReLU activation functions with infinitely wide layers (infinite hidden dimension) {cite}`lu2017expressive`. The universal approximation theorem shows that neural networks are, in the limit of large depth or width, expressive enough to fit any function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning has lots of \"gotchas\" -- easy to make mistakes that make it difficult to implement things yourself. This is especially true with numerical stability, which only reveals itself when your model fails to learn. We will move to a bit of a more abstract software framework than JAX for some examples. We'll use [Keras](https://keras.io/), which is one of many possible choices for deep learning frameworks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to introducing deep learning, I will be as terse as possible. There are good learning resources out there. You should use some of the reading above and tutorials put out by Keras (or PyTorch) to get familiar with the concepts of neural networks and learning."

This is because we do not observe its output. Remember, the solubility will be $y = \\vec{w}g(\\vec{x}) + b$. We'll choose our activation, $\\sigma(\\cdot)$, to be tanh and the output dimension of the hidden-layer to be 32. The choice of tanh is empirical --- there are many choices of non-linearity and they are typically chosen based on efficiency and empirical accuracy.
