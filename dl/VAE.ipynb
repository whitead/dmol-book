    "# Variational Autoencoder\n",
    "\n",
    "A variational autoencoder (VAE) is a kind of **generative** deep learning model that is capable of **unsupervised learning**. Unsupervised learning is the process of fitting models to unlabeled data. A generative model is a specific kind of unsupervised learning model that is capable of *generating* new data points that were not seen in training. Generative models can be viewed as a trained probability distribution over that data: $\\hat{\\textrm{P}}(x)$. You can then draw samples from this distribution. It is generally too difficult to construct $\\hat{\\textrm{P}}(x)$ directly, and so most generative models make some changes to the structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "A VAE approaches this problem by introducing a dummy random variable $z$, which we define to have a normal distribution. We can then rewrite $\\hat{\\textrm{P}}(x)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{\\textrm{P}}(x) = \\int\\,\\hat{\\textrm{P}}\\left(x | z \\right) \\textrm{P}(z)\\,dz\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "using the definition of a marginal and conditional probability. Training $\\hat{\\textrm{P}}\\left(x | z \\right)$ directly is not really possible either, but we can create a symmetric distribution $\\hat{\\textrm{P}}\\left(z | x \\right)$ and train both simultaneously. This symmetric distribution only is created to help us train; our end goal is to find $\\hat{\\textrm{P}}\\left(x | z \\right)$ so that we can obtain $\\hat{\\textrm{P}}(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A VAE is thus a set of two trained conditional probability distributions that operate on the data $x$ and latent variables $z$. The first conditional is $p_\\theta(x | z)$, where $\\theta$ indicates the trainable parameters that we will be fitting. $p_\\theta(x | z)$ is known as the \"decoder\" because it goes from the latent variable $z$ to $x$. The decoder analogy is because you can view $z$ as a kind of encoded compression of $x$. The other conditional is $q_\\phi(z | x)$ and is known as the encoder. We should also not forget that we chose $p(z)$ to have normal distribution."

Our goal is to make our VAE model be able to generate $x_i$, so the loss is the log likelihood that we saw $x_i$: $\\log\\left[\\hat{\\textrm{P}}(x_i)\\right]$.\n",

To approximate $\\log \\textrm{E}_z\\left[p_\\theta(x_i | z)\\right]$ with samples from $q(z | x_i)$, we need to account for the fact that sampling from $q(z | x_i)$ is not identical to sampling from $P(z)$ by adding their ratio to the expression ([importance sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_sampling)).\n",

We'll see later on that we can make the output of $q_\\phi(z | x)$ specifically be a normal distribution to make sure we can easily compute the integral.

The right-hand term involves an integral that can be computed analytically and no sampling is required to estimate it. Remember, in the derivation the KL-divergence term appeared as a correction term to account for the fact that our loss doesn't use $P(z)$ directly, but instead uses the encoder $q_\\phi(z | x_i)$ which generates $z$'s from our training data point $x_i$.

This sounds difficult; we've never seen a neural network output a probability distribution over real number vectors. We can simplify though. We defined $P(z)$ to be normally distributed, let's assume that the form of $q_\\phi(z | x)$ should be normal. Then our neural network could output the parameters to a normal distribution (mean/variance) for $z$, rather than trying to output a probability at every possible $z$ value. It's up to you if you want to have $q_\\phi(z | x)$ output a D-dimensional Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix or just output D independent normal distributions. Having $q_\\phi(z | x)$ output a normal distribution also allows us to analytically simplify the expectation/integral in the KL-divergence term. \n",

As we did for the encoder, we'll assume that $p_\\theta(x | z)$ should be normal and we'll output the parameters of the normal distribution from our network. This requires an update to the reconstruction loss to be a log of a normal, but otherwise things will be identical. \n",

Our new normal distribution parameters for the decoder will have a single observation for a single $x$ in training. If you make the standard deviation trainable, it will just pick infinity as the standard deviation since that will for sure capture the point and you only have one point. Thus, I'll make the decoder standard deviation be a hyperparameter fixed at 0.1.

    "There are three main things to do with a VAE on a trajectory. The first is to go from a trajectory in the feature dimension to the latent dimension. This can simplify analysis of dynamics or act as a reaction coordinate for free energy methods. The second is to generate new conformations. This could be used to fill-in under sampling or perhaps extrapolate to new regions of latent space. You can also use the VAE to examine marginals that are perhaps under-sampled. Finally, you can do optimization on the latent space. For example, you could try to find the most compact structure. We'll examine these examples but there are many other things you could examine. For a more complete model example with attention and 3D coordinates, see Winter et al. {cite}`winter2021auto`. You can find applications of VAEs on trajectories for molecular design {cite}`shmilovich2020discovery`, coarse-graining {cite}`wang2019coarse`, and identifying rare-events {cite}`ribeiro2018reweighted`.

    "* A variational autoencoder is a generative deep learning model capable of unsupervised learning. It is capable of of generating new data points not seen in training.\n",
    "* A VAE is a set of two trained conditional probability distributions that operate on examples from the data $x$ and the latent space $z$. The encoder goes from data to latent and the decoder goes from latent to data.\n",
    "* The loss function is the log likelihood that we observed the training point $x_i$.\n",
    "* Taking the log allows us to sum/average over data to aggregate multiple points.\n",
    "* The VAE can be used for both discrete or continuous features.\n",
    "* The goal with VAE is to reproduce the probability distribution of $x$. Comparing the distribution over $z$ and that of $x$ allows us to evaluate how well the VAE operates.\n",
