    "# Graph Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difficulty for deep learning with molecules is the choice and computation of \"descriptors\". Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a category of deep neural networks whose inputs are graphs. As usual, they are composed of specific layers that input a graph and those layers are what we're interested in. You can find reviews of GNNs in Dwivedi *et al.*{cite}`dwivedi2020benchmarking`, Bronstein *et al.*{cite}`bronstein2017geometric`, and  Wu *et al.*{cite}`wu2020comprehensive`. GNNs can be used for everything from coarse-grained molecular dynamics {cite}`li2020graph` to predicting NMR chemical shifts {cite}`yang2020predicting` to modeling dynamics of solids {cite}`xie2019graph`. Before we dive too deep into them, we must first understand how a graph is represented and how molecules are converted into graphs. "

    "## Representing a Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph $\\mathbf{G}$ is a set of nodes $\\mathbf{V}$ and edges $\\mathbf{E}$. In our setting, node $i$ is defined by a vector $\\vec{v}_i$, so that the set of nodes can be written as a rank 2 tensor. The edges can be represented as an adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{E}$, where if $e_{ij} = 1$ then nodes $i$ and $j$ are connected by an edge. In many fields, graphs are often immediately simplified to be directed and acyclic, which simplifies things. Molecules are instead undirected and have cycles (rings). Thus, our adjacency matrices are always symmetric $e_{ij} = e_{ji}$. Often our edges themselves have features, so that $e_{ij}$ is itself a vector. Then the adjacency matrix becomes a rank 3 tensor. Examples of edge features might be covalent bond order or distance between two nodes.\n",

    "### A simple GNN\n",

    "We will often mention a GNN when we really mean a layer from a GNN. Most GNNs implement a specific layer that can deal with graphs, and so usually we are only concerned with this layer. Let's see an example of a simple layer for a GNN:\n",

    "This equation shows that we first multiply every node feature by trainable weights $w_{jk}$, sum over all node features, and then apply an activation. This will yield a single feature vector for the graph. Is this equation permutation invariant? Yes, because the node index in our expression is index $i$ which can be re-ordered without affecting the output.\n",

    "Let's see an example that is similar, but not permutation invariant:\n",

Then if we swap the node ordering, our weights will no longer align. So if we were to input two methanol molecules, which should have the same output, but we switched two atom numbers, we would get different answers. These simple examples differ from real GNNs in two important ways: (i) they give a single feature vector output, which throws away per-node information, and (ii) they do not use the adjacency matrix. Let's see a real GNN that has these properties while maintaining permutation invariance."

    "One of the first popular GNNs is the Kipf & Welling graph convolutional network (GCN) {cite}`kipf2016semi`. Although some people consider GCNs to be a broad class of GNNs, we'll use GCNs to refer specifically the Kipf & Welling GCN. \n",
    "Thomas Kipf has written an [excellent article introducing the GCN](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/). I will not repeat this article, so please take a look at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to a GCN layer is $\\mathbf{V}$, $\\mathbf{E}$ and it outputs an updated $\\mathbf{V}'$. Each node feature vector is updated. The way it updates a node feature vector is by averaging the feature vectors of its neigbhors, as determined by $\\mathbf{E}$. The choice of averaging over neigbhors is what makes a GCN layer permutation invariant. Averaging over neighbors is not trainable, so we must add trainable parameters. We multiply the neighbor features by a trainable matrix before the averaging, which gives the GCN the ability to learn. In Einstein notation, this process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "v_{il} = \\sigma\\left(\\frac{1}{d_i}e_{ij}v_{jk}w_{lk}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ is the node we're considering, $j$ is the neighbor index, $k$ is the node input feature, $l$ is the ouput node feature, $d_i$ is the degree of node i (which makes it an average instead of sum), $e_{ij}$ isolates neighbors so that all non-neighbor $v_{jk}$s are zero, $\\sigma$ is our activation, and $w_{lk}$ is the trainable weights. This equation is a mouthful, but it truly just is the average over neighbors with a trainable matrix thrown in. One common modification is to make all nodes neighbors of themselves. This is so that the output node features $v_{il}$ depends on the input features $v_{ik}$. We do not need to change our equation, just make the adjacency matrix have $1$s on the diagonal instead of $0$ by adding the identity matrix during pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building understanding about the GCN is important for understanding other GNNs. You can view the GCN layer as a way to \"communicate\" between a node and its neigbhors. The output for node $i$ will depend only on its immediate neigbhors. For chemistry, this is not satisfactory. So you can stack multiple layers. If you have two layers, then the output for node $i$ will include information about node $i$'s neighbors' neigbhors. Another important detail to understand in GCNs is that the averaging procedure accomplishes two goals: (i) it gives permutation invariance by removing the effect of neighbor order and (ii) it prevents a change in magnitude in node features. A sum would accomplish (i) but would cause the magnitude of the node features to grow after each layer. Of course, you could ad-hoc put a batch normalization layer after each GCN layer to keep output magnitudes stable but averaging is easy."

    "This model is definitely underfit. One reason is that our batch size is 1. This is a side-effect of making the number of atoms variable and then Keras/tensorflow has trouble batching together our data if there are two unknown dimensions. You can fix this by manually batching or padding all molecules to have as many atoms as the one with the max. In any case, this example shows how to use GCN layers in a complete model."

    "## Message Passing Viewpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to more broadly view a GCN layer is that it is a kind of \"message-passing\" layer. You first compute a message coming from each neighboring node:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{e}_{{s_i}j} = \\vec{n}_{{s_i}j} \\mathbf{W}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_{{s_i}j}$ means the $j$th neigbhor of node $i$. The $s_i$ means senders to $i$. This is how a GCN computes the messages, it's just a weight matrix times each neighbor node features. After getting the messages that will go to $\\vec{e}_{{s_i}j}$, we aggregate them using a function which is permutation invariant to the order of neigbhors:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{e}_{i} = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{e}_{{s_i}j}|}\\sum \\vec{e}_{{s_i}j} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the GCN this aggregation is just a mean. Finally, we update our node using the aggregated message in the GCN:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{n}^{'}_{i} = \\sigma(\\vec{e}_i)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n^{'}$ indicates the new node features. This is simply the activated aggregated message. Writing it out this way, you can see how it is possible to make small changes. One important paper by Gilmer et al. explored some of these choices and described how this general idea of message passing layers does well in learning to predict molecular energies from quantum mechanics {cite}`gilmer2017neural`. Examples of changes to the above GCN equations are to include edge information when computing the neighbor messages or use a dense neural network layer in place of $\\sigma$. \n",

    "where the $\\textrm{GRU}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is a gated recurrent unit{cite}`chung2014empirical`. The interesting property of a GRU is that it has trainable parameters, giving the model a bit more flexibility, but the GRU parameters do not change as you stack more layers. A GRU is usually used for modeling sequences of undetermined length, like a sentence. What's nice about this is that you can stack infinite GGN layers without increasing the number of trainable parameters (assuming you make $\\mathbf{W}$ the same at each layer). Thus GGNs are suited for large graphs, like a large protein or large unit cell.\n",

    "## Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the message passing viewpoint, and in general for GNNS, the way that messages from neighbors are combined is a key step. This is sometimes called **pooling**, since it's similar to the pooling layer used in convolutional neural networks. Just like in pooling for convolutional neural networsk, there are multiple reduction operations you can use. Typically you see sum or mean in GNNs, but you can be quite sophisticated like in Graph Isomorphism Networks {cite}`xu2018powerful`. We'll see an example in our attention chapter of using self-attention, which is a complicated reduction that could be used for pooling. It can be tempting to focus on this step, but it's been empirically found that the choice of pooling is not so important{cite}`luzhnica2019graph,mesquita2020rethinking`. "

    "## Battaglia General Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, message passing layers is a general way to view GNN layers. Battaglia *et al.* {cite}`battaglia2018relational` went further and created a general set of equations which captures nearly all GNNs. They broke the GNN layer equations down into 3 update equations, like the node update equation we saw in the message passing layer equations, and 3 aggregation equations (6 total equations). There is a new concept in these equations: graph feature vectors. A graph feature vector is a set of features which represent the whole graph or molecule. For example, when computing solubility it may have been useful to build-up a per-molecule feature vector that is eventually used to compute solubility. Any knid of per-molecule quantity like energy can be expressed as a graph-level feature vector. \n",

Note that these are meant to be general expressions and you define $\\phi^e$ for your specific GNN layer. The output edge updates are then aggregated with the first aggregation function:\n",

    "## Nodes vs Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll find that most GNNs use the node-update equation in the Battaglia equations but do not update edges. For example, the GCN will update nodes at each layer but the edges are constant. Some recent work has shown that updating edges can be important for learning when the edges have geometric information, like if the input graph is a molecule and the edges are distance between the atoms {cite}`klicpera2019directional`. As we'll see in the chapter on equivariances ({doc}`../dl/data`), one of the key properties of neural networks with geometric data (i.e., Cartesian xyz coordinates) is to have rotation equivariance. {cite}`klicpera2019directional` showed that you can achieve this if you do edge updates and encode the edge vectors using a rotation equivariant basis set with spherical harmonics and Bessel functions. These kind of edge updating GNNs can be used to predict protein structure {cite}`jing2020learning`."

    "## Common Architecture Motifs and Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now seen message passing layer GNNs, GCNs, GGNs, and the generalized Battaglia equations. You'll find common motifs in the architectures, like gating, attention, and pooling strategies. For example, Gated GNNS (GGNs) can be combined with attention pooling to create Gated Attention GNNs (GAANs){cite}`zhang2018gaan`. GraphSAGE is a similar to a GCN but it samples when pooling, making the neighbor-updates of fixed dimension{cite}`hamilton2017inductive`. So you'll see the suffix \"sage\" when you sample over neighbors while pooling. These can all be represented in the Battaglia equations, but you should be aware of these names. \n",
    "\n",
    "The enormous variety of architectures has led to work on identifying the \"best\" or most general GNN architecture {cite}`dwivedi2020benchmarking,errica2019fair,shchur2018pitfalls`. Unfortunately, the question of which GNN architecture is best is as difficult as \"what benchmark problems are best?\" Thus there are no agreed upon conclusions on the best architecture. However, those papers are great resources on training, hyperparameters, and reasonable starting guesses and I highly recommend reading them before designing your own GNN. There has been some theoretical work to show that simple architectures, like GCNs, cannot distinguish between certain simple graphs {cite}`xu2018powerful`. How much this practically matters depends on your data. Ultimately, there is so much variety in hyperparameters, data equivariances, and training decisions that you should think carefully about how much the GNN architecture matters before exploring it with too much depth.

    "## Do we need graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to convert a graph into a string under certain constraints on the graph. Molecules specifically can be converted into a string. This means you can use sequence deep learning layers (i.e., transformers) and avoid the complexities of graph neural network. SMILES is one common approach to converting molecular graphs into strings. However, SMILES is not surjective meaning there are strings in the SMILES alphabet. It also not injective, meaning there are multiple valid SMILES string for each molecule. Some of the early work on using SMILES focused on teaching generative models (e.g., VAEs) to learn to make valid SMILES. Then, hilariously, someone realized you could just create a new way of converting molecules into strings that was surjective leading to SELFIES {cite}`krenn2020self`. In SELFIES then you can trivially generate molecules. I don't think there is a paper on it yet, but there is a \"superstition\" that working in molecular graphs is more robust because SELFIES and SMILES can vary quite a bit when a molecular graph undergoes a small change (e.g., ring-opening). It is an unresolved question if GNNs are necessary or if we can do everything with SELFIES. "
