    "The biggest difficulty for deep learning with molecules is the choice and computation of \"descriptors\". Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a category of deep neural networks whose inputs are graphs. As usual, they are composed of specific layers that input a graph and those layers are what we're interested in. You can find reviews of GNNs in X, Y, and Z. Before we dive too deep into them, we must first understand how a graph is represented and how molecules are converted into graphs. "

    "## Representing a Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph $\\mathbf{G}$ is a set of nodes $\\mathbf{V}$ and edges $\\mathbf{E}$. In our setting, node $i$ is defined by a vector $\\vec{v}_i$, so that the set of nodes can be written as a rank 2 tensor. The edges can be represented as an adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{E}$, where if $e_{ij} = 1$ then nodes $i$ and $j$ are connected by an edge. In many fields, graphs are often immediately simplified to be directed and acyclic, which simplifies things. Molecules are instead undirected and have cycles (rings). Thus, our adjacency matrices are always symmetric $e_{ij} = e_{ji}$. Often our edges themselves have features, so that $e_{ij}$ is itself a vector. Then the adjacency matrix becomes a rank 3 tensor. Examples of edge features might be covalent bond order or distance between two nodes.\n",

    "This equation shows that we first multiply every node feature by trainable weights $w_{jk}$, sum over all node features, and then apply an activation. This will yield a single feature vector for the graph. Is this equation permutation invariant? Yes, because the node index in our expression is index $i$ which can be re-ordered without affecting the output.\n",

Then if we swap the node ordering, our weights will no longer align. So if we were to input two methanol molecules, which should have the same output, but we switched two atom numbers, we would get different answers. These simple examples differ from real GNNs in two important ways: (i) they give a single feature vector output, which throws away per-node information, and (ii) they do not use the adjacency matrix. Let's see a real GNN that has these properties while maintaining permutation invariance."

    "Thomas Kipf has written an [excellent article introducing the GCN](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/). I will not repeat this article, so please take a look at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to a GCN layer is $\\mathbf{V}$, $\\mathbf{E}$ and it outputs an updated $\\mathbf{V}'$. Each node feature vector is updated. The way it updates a node feature vector is by averaging the feature vectors of its neigbhors, as determined by $\\mathbf{E}$. The choice of averaging over neigbhors is what makes a GCN layer permutation invariant. Averaging over neighbors is not trainable, so we must add trainable parameters. We multiply the neighbor features by a trainable matrix before the averaging, which gives the GCN the ability to learn. In Einstein notation, this process is:\n",

    "v_{il} = \\sigma\\left(\\frac{1}{d_i}e_{ij}v_{jk}w_{lk}\\right)\n",

    "\n",
    "where $i$ is the node we're considering, $j$ is the neighbor index, $k$ is the node input feature, $l$ is the ouput node feature, $d_i$ is the degree of node i (which makes it an average instead of sum), $e_{ij}$ isolates neighbors so that all non-neighbor $v_{jk}$s are zero, $\\sigma$ is our activation, and $w_{lk}$ is the trainable weights. This equation is a mouthful, but it truly just is the average over neighbors with a trainable matrix thrown in. One common modification is to make all nodes neighbors of themselves. This is so that the output node features $v_{il}$ depends on the input features $v_{ik}$. We do not need to change our equation, just make the adjacency matrix have $1$s on the diagonal instead of $0$ by adding the identity matrix during pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building understanding about the GCN is important for understanding other GNNs. You can view the GCN layer as a way to \"communicate\" between a node and its neigbhors. The output for node $i$ will depend only on its immediate neigbhors. For chemistry, this is not satisfactory. So you can stack multiple layers. If you have two layers, then the output for node $i$ will include information about node $i$'s neighbors' neigbhors. Another important detail to understand in GCNs is that the averaging procedure accomplishes two goals: (i) it gives permutation invariance by removing the effect of neighbor order and (ii) it prevents a change in magnitude in node features. A sum would accomplish (i) but would cause the magnitude of the node features to grow after each layer. Of course, you could ad-hoc put a batch normalization layer after each GCN layer to keep output magnitudes stable but averaging is easy."

    "This model is definitely underfit. One reason is that our batch size is 1. This is an side-effect of making the number of atoms variable and then tensorflow has trouble batching together our data if there are two unknown dimensions. You can fix this by manually batching or padding all molecules to have as many atoms as the one with the max. In any case, this example shows how to use GCN layers in a complete model."

    "## Message Passing Viewpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to more broadly view a GCN layer is that it is a kind of \"message-passing\" layer. You first compute a message coming from each neighboring node:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{e}_{{s_i}j} = \\vec{n}_{{s_i}j} \\mathbf{W}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_{{s_i}j}$ means the $j$th neigbhor of node $i$. The $s_i$ means senders to $i$. This is how a GCN computes the messages, it's just a weight matrix times each neighbor node features. After getting the messages that will go to $\\vec{e}_{{s_i}j}$, we aggregate them using a function which is permutation invariant to the order of neigbhors:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{e}_{i} = \\frac{1}{|\\vec{e}_{{s_i}j}|}\\sum \\vec{e}_{{s_i}j} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the GCN this aggregation is just a mean. Finally, we update our node using the aggregated message in the GCN:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{n}^{'}_{i} = \\sigma(\\vec{e}_i)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n^{'}$ indicates the new node features. This is simply the activated aggregated message. Writing it out this way, you can see how it is possible to make small changes. One important paper by Gilmer et al. explored some of these choices and described how this general idea of message passing layers does well in learning to predict molecular energies from quantum mechanics {cite}`gilmer2017neural`. Examples of changes to the above GCN equations are to include edge information when computing the neighbor messages or use a dense neural network layer in place of $\\sigma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Gated Graph Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One important variant of the message passing layer is the **gated graph neural network** (GGN) {cite}`li2015gated`. It replaces the last equation, the node update, with\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{n}^{'}_{i} = \\textrm{GRU}(\\vec{n}_i, \\vec{e}_i)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $\\textrm{GRU}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is a gated recurrent unit{cite}`chung2014empirical`. The interesting property of a GRU is that it has trainable parameters, giving the model a bit more flexibility, but the GRU parameters do not change as you stack more layers. A GRU is usually used for modeling sequences of undetermined length, like a sentence. What's nice about this is that you can stack infinite GGN layers without increasing the number of trainable parameters (assuming you make $\\mathbf{W}$ the same at each layer). Thus GGNs are suited for large graphs, like a large protein or large unit cell. \n"

    "## Battaglia General Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, message passing layers is a general way to view GNN layers. Battaglia et al {cite}`battaglia2018relational` went further and created a general set of equations which captures nearly all GNNs. They broke the GNN layer equations down into 3 update equations, like the node update equation we saw in the message passing layer equations, and 3 aggregation equations. There is a new concept in these equations: graph feature vectors. A graph feature vector is a set of features which represent the whole graph or molecule. For example, when computing solubility it may have been useful to build-up a per-molecule feature vector that is eventually used to compute solubility. Any knid of per-molecule quantity like energy can be expressed as a graph-level feature vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in these equations is updating the edge feature vectors, written as $\\vec{e}_k$, which we haven't seen yet but is certainly possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{e}^{'}_k = \\phi^e\\left( \\vec{e}_k, \\vec{v}_{rk}, \\vec{v}_{sk}, \\vec{u}\\right)\n",
