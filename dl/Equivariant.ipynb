    "# Equvariant Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "```{danger}\n",
    "This chapter is being written\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapter {doc}`data` discussed data transformation and network architecture decisions that can be made to make a neural network equivariant with respect to translation, rotation, and permutations. However, those ideas limit the expressibility of our networks and are constructed ad-hoc. Now we will take a more systematic approach to defining equivariances and prove that there is only one layer type that can preserve a given equivariance. The result of this section will be layers that can be equivariant with respect to any transform, even for more esoteric cases like points on a sphere or mirror operations. To achieve this, we will need tools from group theory, representation theory, harmonic analysis, and deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do you need equivariance?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "I'm being a bit unfair, these papers have some slightly different application areas (lie vs compact vs finite groups) and differ mostly in their non-linearity. However, it can be hard to discern what is truly different about these papers because of the differences in their derivations.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get too far, let me first try to talk you out of equivariant networks. The math required is advanced, especially because the theory of these is still in flux. There are four papers in the last few years that propose a general theory for equivariant networks and they each take a slightly different approach {cite}`finzi2020generalizing,cohen2019general,kondor2018generalization,lang2020wigner`. It is also easy to make mistakes in implementations due to the complexity of the methods. You also must do implementations (as of 2020) because there are no efficient general implementations for equivariant networks. You will also find that equivariant networks do not beat generally beat state of the art models on many of the tasks they're design for -- although that is now quickly changing at the end of 2020 with recent benchmarks set in point cloud segmentation {cite}`wang2020equivariant`, molecular force field prediction {cite}`batzner2021se3equivariant`, and molecular energy predictions {cite}`klicpera2020directional`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives to equivariant networks are training and testing augmentation. Both are powerful methods for many domains and are easy to implement. You can also do data transformations like discussed in {doc}`data` to avoid equivariance. So why would you study this chapter? I think these ideas are important and incorporating the equivariant layers into other network architectures can dramatically reduce parameter numbers and training efficiency."

    "We have to lay some mathematical foundations before we can grasp the equations and details of equivariant networks. We'll start with a brief overview of group theory so we can define the principle of equivariance generally. Then we'll show how any equivariance can be enforced in a neural network via a generalization of convolutions. Then we'll visit representation theory to see how to encode groups into matrices.  Then we'll see how these convolutions can be more easily represented using the generalization of Fourier transforms. Finally, we'll see some of the special details when looking at equivariances of permutations. Throughout this chapter we'll see three examples that capture some of the different settings. Remember, that I am a chemical engineer so that some of this chapter will probably have reckless math. "

    "## Group Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "A modern treatment of group theory can be found in {cite}`zee2016`. A group is a general object in mathematics. A group is a set of elements that can be combined in a binary operation whose output is another member of the group. The most common example are the integers. If you combine two integers in a binary operation, the output is another integer. Of course, it depends on the operation ($1 \\div 2$ does not give an integer), so specifically consider addition. Integers are not the example we care about though. We're interested in groups of **transformations** that move points in a space. Operations like rotation, scaling, mirroring, or translating of single points. As you read about groups here, remember that the elements of the groups are *not* numbers or points. The group elements are transformations that act on points in the space. Notice I'm being a bit nebulous on what the space is for now. Let's first define a group: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Group Definition\n",
    "A group $G$ is a set of elements (e.g., $\\{a, b, c, i, e\\}$) equipped with a binary operation ($a\\cdot{}b = c$) whose output is another group element and the following conditions are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Closure** The output of the binary operation is always a member of the group\n",
    "2. **Associativity** $(a\\cdot{}b)\\cdot{}c = a\\cdot{}(b\\cdot{}c)$\n",
    "3. **Identity** There is a single identity element $e$ such that $ex = x \\forall x \\in G$\n",
    "4. **Inverse** There exists exactly one inverse element $i$ for each $x$ such that $xi = e$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite a bit of nice structure. We always have an inverse available. Applying the binary operations never accidentally leaves our group. One important property that is missing from this list is **commutativity**. In general, a group is not commutative so that $a\\cdot{}b \\neq b\\cdot{}a$. If the group does have this extra property, we call the group **abelian**. Another detail is how big the set is. It can indeed be infinite, which is why the integers or all possible rotations of a sphere can be represented as a group. One notational convenience we'll make is that the binary operation \"$\\cdot{}$\" will just be referred to as multiplication. The number of elements in a group $|G|$ is known as the **order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "If you multiply two transforms $a\\cdot{}b$, we always apply $b$ first and then $a$. This is important to remember for non-commutative groups (non-abelian). \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of introducing the groups is so that they can transforms elements of our space. This is done through a **group action**\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Group Action\n",
    "A group action $\\phi(g, v)$ is a mapping from a group $G$ and a space $\\mathcal{X}$ to the space $\\mathcal{X}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\phi: G\\times \\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{X}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So a group action takes in two arguments (binary): a group element and a point in a space $\\mathcal{X}$ and transforms the point to a new one: $\\phi(g, x_0) = x_1$. This is just a more systematic way of saying it transforms a point. The group action is neither unique to the space nor group. Often we'll omit the function notation for the group action and just write $gx = x'$. "

    "The first group is about rotations of a hexagon {glue:}`hex-6`. Our basic group member will be rotating the hexagon enough to shift all the vertices: {glue:}`hex-0` $\\rightarrow$ {glue:}`hex-1`. Notice I've colored the vertices and added a line so we can easily distinguish the orientation of the hexagon. Remember the hexagon, its colors, and if it is actually symmetric have nothing to do with the group. *The group elements are transformations we apply to the hexagon*.\n",
    "\n",
    "One group action for this example can use modular arithmetic. If we represent a point in our space as $\\left\\{0,\\ldots, 5\\right\\}$ then the rotation transformation is $x' = x + 1 \\;(\\bmod\\; 6)$. For example, if we start at $5$ and rotate, we get back to $0$. \n",

    "Our group must contain our rotation transformation $r$ and the identity: $\\{e, r\\}$. This set is not closed though: rotating twice $r\\cdot{}r$ {glue:}`hex-0` $\\rightarrow$ {glue:}`hex-1` $\\rightarrow$ {glue:}`hex-2` gives a new group element $r^2$.

Considering rotations alone first, like last time we should only need up to $r^3$. Here are the rotations visually: {glue:}`quad-0-0`, {glue:}`quad-1-0`, {glue:}`quad-2-0`, {glue:}`quad-3-0` What about mirroring on horizontal/vertical? Mirroring along the horizontal axis: {glue:}`quad-0-0` $\\rightarrow$ {glue:}`quad-2-1` is actually the same as rotating twice and then mirroring along the vertical.

However, $s\\cdot{}r$ is {glue:}`quad-0-0` $\\rightarrow$ {glue:}`quad-1-0` $\\rightarrow$ {glue:}`quad-3-1`, which is the group element $r^3s$.\n",

    "Now consider the translation group elements. For simplicity, let's only consider integer translations. We can label them as $t_{w,h}$. So $t_{3,4}$ means translate by $x + 3$ and $y + 4$. Is this a proper group? Certainly it associative, there is an identity $t_{0,0}$ and an inverse for each element $t_{-x, -y}$. What about closure? Yes, since translating twice is equivalent to one larger translation: $t_{w,h}\\cdot{}t_{w', h'} = t_{w + w', h + h'}$. This expression also shows group action for translation. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about when we combine with our other elements from the $D_4$ group? Consider the product $r\\cdot{}t_{3,4}$. This means translating by $(3,4)$ and then rotating by 90° about the origin. If you consider this acting on a single point $(0,0)$, you could get $(0,0) \\rightarrow (3,4) \\rightarrow (-3,4)$. What element of our group would this represent? At first it seems like it could be $t_{-3,4}$. However, $t_{-3,4}$ would only work specifically for starting at $(0,0)$. If you started at $(1,1)$, you would get to $(-4,5)$ with $r\\cdot{}t_{3,4}$ and $(-2,5)$ with $t_{-3,4}$. To be correct for *any point*, we need a different group element. So the product $r\\cdot{}t_{3,4}$ actually cannot be a product but instead must be a group element. In fact, our new combined group is just going to be $ab$ where $a$ is an element from $D_4$ and $b$ is a translation. Thus $r\\cdot{}t_{3,4} = rt_{3,4}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Combing these two groups, the translation and $D_4$, is an example of a **semidirect product**. A semidirect product just means that we create a new group by combining all possible group elements. There is some machinery for this, like the identity element in our new group is something like $et_{0,0}$, and it has some other structure. It is called semidirect, instead of direct, because we can actually mix our group elements. The elements both act on points in the same space ($x,y$ plane), so this make sense. Another condition is that we can only have a semidirect product when one subgroup is normal and the translation subgroup is the normal subgroup. It is coincidentally abelian, but these two properties are not always identical. This semidirect product group is called p4m.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, is an optional section that formalizes the idea of combining these two groups into one larger group.\n",

    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Normal Subgroup\n",
    "A normal subgroup is a group of elements $n$ from the group $G$ called $N$. Each $n \\in N$ should have the property that $g\\cdot{}n\\cdot{}g^{-1}$ gives an element in $N$ for any $g$.  \n",

    "This does not mean $g\\cdot{}n\\cdot{}g^{-1} = n$, but instead that $g\\cdot{}n\\cdot{}g^{-1} = n'$ where $n'$ is some other element in $N$. For example, in p4m the translations form a normal subgroup. Rotating, translating, then doing the inverse of the rotation is equivalent to some translation. Notice that $D_4$ is not a normal subgroup of p4m. If you do an inverse translation, rotate, then do a translation you may not have something equivalent to a rotation. It may be strange that we're talking about the group p4m when we haven't yet described how it's defined (identity, inverse, binary op). We'll do that with the semidirect product and then we could go back and verify that the translations are a normal subgroup more rigorously. I do not know the exact connection, but it seems that normal subgroups are typically abelian. \n",

    "We are technically doing an outter semidirect product: combining them under the assumption that both $D_4$ and $T$ are part of a larger group which contains both. This is a bit of a semantic detail, but they are actually both part of $p4m$ and a larger group called the affine group which includes translation, rotation, shear, translation, mirror, and scale operations on points. You could also argue they are part of groups which can be represented by 3x3 invertible matrices. Thus, you can combine these and get something that is still smaller than their larger containing group ($p4m$ is smaller than all affine transformations).\n",

We should write the first element of this binary product $r$ as a tuple of group elements: one from the $D_4$ and one from the translations. Since there is no translation for $r$, we use the identity. Thus we write $r$ as $(t_{0,0}, r)$ in our semidirect product group p4m. Note that the normal subgroup comes first (applied last) by convention. Similarly, $t_{3,4}$ is written as $(t_{3,4}, e)$. Our equation becomes:\n",

    "We've defined transforms and their relationships to one another via group theory. Now we need to actually connect the transforms to a space. It is helpful to think about the space as Euclidean with a concept of distance and coordinates, but we'll see that this is not required. Our space could be vertices on a graph or integers or classes. There are *some* requirements though. The first is that our space must be **homogeneous**. Homogeneous means that from any point in our space $x$ we can reach any other point with a transform $g$ from our group $G$. The second requirement is that if our group is infinite, the space must **compact**. Compactness is a concept from topology and essentially means that the space is smooth and differentiable. This is true of most spaces we'll see in chemistry or materials science, except there may be issues at poles on a sphere or other singular points. This doesn't matter for finite groups, so we can use non-compact spaces like vertices on a graph for finite groups. If the group transforms are further smooth and have smooth inverses, the group (and associated space) are called a **lie group**. \n",

    "You should be thinking now about how we can define equivariance using our new groups. That's where we're headed. We need to do a bit of work now to \"lift\" neural networks and our features into the framework we're building. First, in {doc}`data` we defined our features as being composed of tuples $(\\vec{r}_i, \\vec{x}_i)$ where $\\vec{r}_i$ is a spatial point and $\\vec{x}_i$ are the features at that point. Let's now view these input data as functions, defined as $f(\\vec{r}) = \\vec{x}$ and assume if a point $\\vec{r}'$ isn't in our training data then $f(\\vec{r}') = \\vec{0}$. More formally, our training data is a function $f:\\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$ that maps from our homogeneous space $\\mathcal{x}$ to real vector (or complex vectors) of dimension $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have promoted our data into a function and now a neural network can no longer be just function since its input is a function. Our neural network will be also promoted to an **linear map**, which has an input of a function and an output of a function. Formally, our network $\\psi: f(\\mathcal{X}) \\rightarrow f'(\\mathcal{X})$. Notice the input and output spaces of the functions should be the same (we cannot switch from 2D to 3D). Linear maps are also called **operators**, depending on which branch of mathematics you're in.\n",

The image is defined by the function $f(x,y) = (r, g, b)$, where $r,g,b$ is the color. We want $T_g f(x, y)$. Without knowing about groups, you can intuit that translating can be done by creating a new function $f'(x', y') = f(x - 10, y)$.

In a specific example, if we rotate the input by 90 degrees, that's the same result as rotating the output by 90 degrees. Take a moment to ensure that matches your idea of what equivariance means.

We will easily fix this because there is a (bijective) way to assign one group element to each point in the space. The second detail is the $f \\uparrow^G$. The order of the group $G$ is greater than or equal to the number of points in our space, so if the function is defined on our space, we must \"lift\" it up to the group $G$ which has more elements. The last detail is the point about **quotient spaces**. Quotient spaces are how we cut-up our group $G$ into subgroups so that one has the same order as the number of points in our space. Below I detail these new concepts just enough so that we can implement and understand these convolutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can convert between functions on the space $\\mathcal{X}$ and functions on the group $G$. $|G| \\geq |\\mathcal{X}|$ so it is rare that we can uniquely replace each point in space with a group in $G$. Instead, we will construct a partitioning of $G$ into $|\\mathcal{X}|$ sets called a quotient space $G / H$ such that $|G / H| = |\\mathcal{X}|$. It turns out, there is a well-studied approach to arranging elements in a group called **costets**. Constructing cosets is a two-step process. First we define a subgroup $H$. A **subgroup** means it is itself a group; it has identities and inverses. We cannot accidentally leave $H$, $h_1\\cdot{} h_2 \\in H$. For example, translation transformations are a subgroup because you cannot accidentally create a rotation when combining two translations. \n",

What happens if $g$ is in $H$? No problem; $H$ is a group so applying an element to every element in $H$ just gives back $H$ (i.e. $hH = H$). Cosets are not groups, they are definitely not closed or have inverses. What's the point of making all these cosets? Remember our goal is to partition $G$ into a bunch of smaller sets so that we have one for each point in $\\mathcal{X}$. Constructing cosets partitions $G$ for sure, but do we get enough? Could we accidentally have overlaps between cosets, where $g_1H$ and $g_2H$ contain the same elements? \n",

It turns out that all the group elements that satisfy the equation will be in the same coset.

    "## G-Equivariant Convolutions with Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we treat the p4m group? We cannot directly use the continuous convolution definition because the rotations/mirror subgroup is finite and we cannot use the finite convolution because the translation subgroup is locally compact (infinitely many elements). Instead, we will exploit the structure of the group: it is constructed via a semidirect product so each group element is a pair of elements. Namely we can rewrite Equation 8.6 using the constituent subgroups $N \\rtimes H$ and writing elements $g = hn, g^{-1} = n^{-1}h^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "Remember that $g = nh$ is fine to use because $(n, e_r)\\cdot (e_n, h) = (n, h)$, whereas the reverse requires using the conjugation $\\phi(h)(n)$ (not to be confused with the kernel $\\phi(g)$).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "(f * \\phi)(u) = \\sum_{n \\in N}\\sum_{h \\in H} f\\uparrow^G\\left(un^{-1}h^{-1}\\right)\\phi(hn)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we must treat the fact that there are an infinite number of elements in $N$ (the translations). We can simply choose the kernel function ($\\phi$) to only have support ($\\phi(g) > 0$) at locations we want and that will simplify the integration. This may seem ad-hoc -- but remember we already made choices like not including 45° rotations. There do exist ways to systematically treat how to narrow the kernels into \"neigbhorhoods\" of groups in {cite}`finzi2020generalizing` or you can find a rigorous derivation specifically for p4 in {cite}`romero2020attentive` or {cite}`cohen2016group`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "I have a hidden cell below which does a bit of magic. It makes the group elements be hashable. That in turn allows me to cache my functions, enabling much faster speeds. This code would be unusable otherwise due to all the nested loops.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for the p4m group is image data, so we'll limit the support of the kernel to only integer translations (like pixels) and limit the distance to 5 units. This simply reduces our sum over the normal subrgroup ($N$). We can now begin our implementation. We'll start by loading an image which will serve as our function. It is a $64\\times64$ RGB image. Remember that we need to allow points to have 3 dimensions, where the third dimension is always 1 to accommodate our augmented space."

    "## Group Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "p4m was an infinite group but we restricted ourselves to a finite subset. Before we can progress to move to truly infinite locally compact groups, like SO(3), we need to learn how to systematically represent the group element binary operation. You can find a detailed description of representation theory in Serre {cite}`serre1977linear`. Thus far, we've discussed the group actions -- how they affect a point. Now we need to describe how to represent them with matrices. This will be a very quick overview of this topic, but representation of groups is a large area with well-established references. There is specifically a great amount of literature about building up these representations, but we'll try to focus on using them since you generally can look-up the representations for most groups we'll operate in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first define a representation on a group:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Linear Representation of a Group\n",
    "Let $G$ be a group on an $n$-dimensional vector space $\\mathcal{X}$ . A linear representation of $G$ is a group homomorphism: $\\rho: G \\rightarrow GL(m,\\mathbb{C})$ where $GL(m, \\mathbb{C})$ is the space of $m\\times m$ square invertible matrices with complex numbers. The representation $\\rho$ should satisfy the following equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\label{rep-def}\n",
    "\\rho\\left(g_1\\cdot g_2\\right) = \\rho\\left(g_1\\right) \\rho\\left(g_2\\right)\\; \\forall\\, g_1,g_2 \\in G\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the term $\\rho\\left(g_1\\right) \\rho\\left(g_2\\right)$ is a matrix product. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things to note about this definition. First, the representation assigns matrices to graph elements in such a way that multiplying matrices gives the same representation as getting the representation of the binary operation ($\\rho\\left(g_1\\cdot g_2\\right)$). Second, the matrices have to be square and invertible. This follows from the requirement that group elements must have an inverse, so naturally we need invertible matrices. The invertible requirement also means we must allow complex numbers. Third, the **degree** of the representation ($m$) need not be the same size as the vector space. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a big detail missing from this definition. Does this have anything to do with how the group element affect a point? No. The way a group affects a point the **group action**, which maps from the direct product of $G, \\mathcal{X}$ (i.e., a tuple like $(g_2, x)$ to $\\mathcal{X}$. Yet a group action is also a representation and a *linear* group action can form a matrix representation. Consider we write the group action $\\pi$ (how a group element affects a point) as $\\pi(g)(x) = x'$. You can convert this into a square matrix in $\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}$ by considering how each element of $x'$ is affected the element in $x$. This matrix can be further shown to be in $GL(m, \\mathcal{X})$ and a representation by relying on its linearity. A combined linear group action and representation constructed this way is sometimes called the **regular representation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*We've simplified the problem of finding a representation to creating a matrix that describes how a point is transformed for any group element $g$ called a linear group action.* I will mention one more way you can construct representations via **induced representations**. If you are unable to construct a representation or group action directly and your group was constructed via a semidirect or direct product, you can build it by first defining a representation on a *normal* subgroup $H$ and then use an **induced action** to create a representation of the whole group $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now see our group representations on the examples. \n"

If you're comfortable with complex numbers, you can build circulant matrices of $6$th roots of unity. If that confuses you, like it does me, then you can also just view this group like a rotation group. Just like how if you rotate enough times you get back to the beginning, you can also use rotation matrices of $360 / 6 = 60^{\\circ}$. This requires a 2D vector representation though for the space.

    "\n",
    "These representations that both describe the group action and how group elements affect on another are typically **reducible**, meaning if you drop the requirement that they also describe group action they can be simplified. The process of reducing representations is again a topic best left to another reference and/or looked-up. These irreducible representations are like orthonormal basis-functions or basis-vectors from Hilbert spaces. We'll use them for Fourier transforms in a moment. One important fact you should know is that they can be complex and if a group is non-abelian there will be matrices. That means the individual representations can have different dimensions. From now on, I will only continue the locally compact examples since we already saw how to easily treat finite groups. \n",
