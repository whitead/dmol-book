    "# Equivariant Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapter {doc}`data` discussed data transformation and network architecture decisions that can be made to make a neural network equivariant with respect to translation, rotation, and permutations. However, those ideas limit the expressibility of our networks and are constructed ad-hoc. Now we will take a more systematic approach to defining equivariances and prove that there is only one layer type that can preserve a given equivariance. The result of this section will be layers that can be equivariant with respect to any transform, even for more esoteric cases like points on a sphere or mirror operations. To achieve this, we will need tools from group theory, representation theory, harmonic analysis, and deep learning. Equivariant neural networks are part of a broader topic of **geometric deep learning**, which is learning with non-Euclidean (x,y,z) spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do you need equivariance?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "I'm being a bit unfair, these papers have some slightly different application areas (lie vs compact vs finite groups) and differ mostly in their non-linearity.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get too far, let me first try to talk you out of equivariant networks. The math required is advanced, especially because the theory of these is still in flux. There are five papers in the last few years that propose a general theory for equivariant networks and they each take a slightly different approach {cite}`finzi2020generalizing,cohen2019general,kondor2018generalization,lang2020wigner,finzi2021emlp`. It is also easy to make mistakes in implementations due to the complexity of the methods. You also must do implementations (as of early 2021) because there are no efficient general implementations for equivariant networks. You will also find that equivariant networks do not generally beat state of the art models on many of the tasks they're design for -- although that is now quickly changing at the end of 2020 with recent benchmarks set in point cloud segmentation {cite}`wang2020equivariant`, molecular force field prediction {cite}`batzner2021se3equivariant`, molecular energy predictions {cite}`klicpera2020directional`, and 3D molecular structure generation {cite}`satorras2021en`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives to equivariant networks are training and testing augmentation. Both are powerful methods for many domains and are easy to implement. However, they do not work for locally compact symmetry groups (e.g., SO(3)), so you cannot use them for rotationally equivariant data. You can do data transformations like discussed in {doc}`data` to avoid equivariance. So why would you study this chapter? I think these ideas are important and incorporating the equivariant layers into other network architectures can dramatically reduce parameter numbers and increase training efficiency."

    "We have to lay some mathematical foundations before we can grasp the equations and details of equivariant networks. We'll start with a brief overview of group theory so we can define the principle of equivariance generally. Then we'll show how any equivariance can be enforced in a neural network via a generalization of convolutions. Then we'll visit representation theory to see how to encode groups into matrices.  Then we'll see how these convolutions can be more easily represented using the generalization of Fourier transforms. Finally, we'll examine some implementations. Throughout this chapter we'll see three examples that capture some of the different settings."

    "A group is a general object in mathematics. A group is a set of elements that can be combined in a binary operation whose output is another member of the group. The most common example are the integers. If you combine two integers in a binary operation, the output is another integer. Of course, it depends on the operation ($1 \\div 2$ does not give an integer), so specifically consider addition. Integers are not the example we care about though. We're interested in groups of **transformations** that move points in a space. Operations like rotation, scaling, mirroring, or translating of single points. As you read about groups here, remember that the elements of the groups are *not* numbers or points. The group elements are transformations that act on points in the space. Notice I'm being a bit nebulous on what the space is for now. Let's first define a group: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Group Definition\n",
    "A group $G$ is a set of elements (e.g., $\\{a, b, c, i, e\\}$) equipped with a binary operation ($a\\cdot{}b = c$) whose output is another group element and the following conditions are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Closure** The output of the binary operation is always a member of the group\n",
    "2. **Associativity** $(a\\cdot{}b)\\cdot{}c = a\\cdot{}(b\\cdot{}c)$\n",
    "3. **Identity** There is a single identity element $e$ such that $ex = x \\forall x \\in G$\n",
    "4. **Inverse** There exists exactly one inverse element $i$ for each $x$ such that $xi = e$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite a bit of nice structure. We always have an inverse available. Applying the binary operations never accidentally leaves our group. One important property that is missing from this list is **commutativity**. In general, a group is not commutative so that $a\\cdot{}b \\neq b\\cdot{}a$. If the group does have this extra property, we call the group **abelian**. Another detail is how big the set is. It can indeed be infinite, which is why the integers or all possible rotations of a sphere can be represented as a group. One notational convenience we'll make is that the binary operation \"$\\cdot{}$\" will just be referred to as multiplication. The number of elements in a group $|G|$ is known as the **order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "If you multiply two transforms $a\\cdot{}b$, we always apply $b$ first and then $a$. This is important to remember for non-commutative groups (non-abelian). \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of introducing the groups is so that they can transforms elements of our space. This is done through a **group action**\n",

Considering rotations alone first, like last time we should only need up to $r^3$. Here are the rotations visually: {glue:}`quad-0-0`, {glue:}`quad-1-0`, {glue:}`quad-2-0`, {glue:}`quad-3-0` What about mirroring on horizontal/vertical?

Is this a proper group? Certainly it associative, there is an identity $t_{0,0}$ and an inverse for each element $t_{-x, -y}$. What about closure? Yes, since translating twice is equivalent to one larger translation: $t_{w,h}\\cdot{}t_{w', h'} = t_{w + w', h + h'}$. This expression also shows group action for translation. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about when we combine with our other elements from the $D_4$ group? Consider the product $r\\cdot{}t_{3,4}$. This means translating by $(3,4)$ and then rotating by 90° about the origin. If you consider this acting on a single point $(0,0)$, you could get $(0,0) \\rightarrow (3,4) \\rightarrow (-3,4)$. What element of our group would this represent? At first it seems like it could be $t_{-3,4}$. However, $t_{-3,4}$ would only work specifically for starting at $(0,0)$. If you started at $(1,1)$, you would get to $(-4,5)$ with $r\\cdot{}t_{3,4}$ and $(-2,5)$ with $t_{-3,4}$. To be correct for *any point*, we need a different group element. So the product $r\\cdot{}t_{3,4}$ actually cannot be a product but instead must be a group element. In fact, our new combined group is just going to be $ab$ where $a$ is an element from $D_4$ and $b$ is a translation. Thus $r\\cdot{}t_{3,4} = rt_{3,4}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Combing these two groups, the translation and $D_4$, is an example of a **semidirect product**. A semidirect product just means that we create a new group by combining all possible group elements. There is some machinery for this, like the identity element in our new group is something like $et_{0,0}$, and it has some other structure. It is called semidirect, instead of direct, because we can actually mix our group elements. The elements both act on points in the same space ($x,y$ plane), so this make sense. Another condition is that we can only have a semidirect product when one subgroup is normal and the translation subgroup is the normal subgroup. It is coincidentally abelian, but these two properties are not always identical. This semidirect product group is called p4m.\n",

For example, in p4m the translations form a normal subgroup. Rotating, translating, then doing the inverse of the rotation is equivalent to some translation. Notice that $D_4$ is not a normal subgroup of p4m. If you do an inverse translation, rotate, then do a translation you may not have something equivalent to a rotation. It may be strange that we're talking about the group p4m when we haven't yet described how it's defined (identity, inverse, binary op). We'll do that with the semidirect product and then we could go back and verify that the translations are a normal subgroup more rigorously. I do not know the exact connection, but it seems that normal subgroups are typically abelian. \n",

You could also argue they are part of groups which can be represented by 3x3 invertible matrices. Thus, you can combine these and get something that is still smaller than their larger containing group ($p4m$ is smaller than all affine transformations).\n",

Since there is no translation for $r$, we use the identity. Thus we write $r$ as $(t_{0,0}, r)$ in our semidirect product group p4m.

    "We've defined transforms and their relationships to one another via group theory. Now we need to actually connect the transforms to a space. It is helpful to think about the space as Euclidean with a concept of distance and coordinates, but we'll see that this is not required. Our space could be vertices on a graph or integers or classes. There are *some* requirements though. The first is that our space must be **homogeneous**. Homogeneous means that from any point in our space $x$ we can reach any other point with a transform $g$ from our group $G$. The second requirement is that if our group is infinite, the space must **locally compact**. This is a concept from topology and we won't really ever be troubled by it. Most spaces we'll see in chemistry or materials science (Euclidean spaces) are locally compact. This doesn't matter for finite groups, so we can use non-compact spaces. If the group transforms are further smooth and have smooth inverses, the group (and associated space) are called a **lie group**. \n",

Let's now view these input data as functions, defined as $f(\\vec{r}) = \\vec{x}$ and assume if a point $\\vec{r}'$ isn't in our training data then $f(\\vec{r}') = \\vec{0}$. More formally, our training data is a function $f:\\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$ that maps from our homogeneous space $\\mathcal{x}$ to real vector (or complex vectors) of dimension $n$. \n",

Without knowing about groups, you can intuit that translating can be done by creating a new function $f'(x', y') = f(x - 10, y)$.

The order of the group $G$ is greater than or equal to the number of points in our space, so if the function is defined on our space, we must \"lift\" it up to the group $G$ which has more elements. The last detail is the point about **quotient spaces**. Quotient spaces are how we cut-up our group $G$ into subgroups so that one has the same order as the number of points in our space.

    "Let's see how we can convert between functions on the space $\\mathcal{X}$ and functions on the group $G$. $|G| \\geq |\\mathcal{X}|$ (because the space is homogeneous) so it is rare that we can uniquely replace each point in space with a group in $G$. Instead, we will construct a partitioning of $G$ into $|\\mathcal{X}|$ sets called a quotient space $G / H$ such that $|G / H| = |\\mathcal{X}|$. It turns out, there is a well-studied approach to arranging elements in a group called **cosets**. Constructing cosets is a two-step process. First we define a subgroup $H$. A **subgroup** means it is itself a group; it has identities and inverses. We cannot accidentally leave $H$, $h_1\\cdot{} h_2 \\in H$. For example, translation transformations are a subgroup because you cannot accidentally create a rotation when combining two translations. \n",

Cosets are not groups, they are definitely not closed or have inverses. What's the point of making all these cosets? Remember our goal is to partition $G$ into a bunch of smaller sets so that we have one for each point in $\\mathcal{X}$. Constructing cosets partitions $G$ for sure, but do we get enough?

One last detail is that it would be nice to visualize this, so we can add a nonlinearity to remap our output back to color space.

    "## G-Equivariant Convolutions with Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we treat the p4m group? We cannot directly use the continuous convolution definition because the rotations/mirror subgroup is finite and we cannot use the finite convolution because the translation subgroup is locally compact (infinitely many elements). Instead, we will exploit the structure of the group: it is constructed via a semidirect product so each group element is a pair of elements. Namely we can rewrite Equation 8.6 using the constituent subgroups $N \\rtimes H$ and writing elements $g = hn, g^{-1} = n^{-1}h^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "Remember that $g = nh$ is fine to use because $(n, e_r)\\cdot (e_n, h) = (n, h)$, whereas the reverse requires using the conjugation $\\phi(h)(n)$ (not to be confused with the kernel $\\phi(g)$).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "(f * \\phi)(u) = \\sum_{n \\in N}\\sum_{h \\in H} f\\uparrow^G\\left(un^{-1}h^{-1}\\right)\\phi(hn)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we must treat the fact that there are an infinite number of elements in $N$ (the translations). We can simply choose the kernel function ($\\phi$) to only have support ($\\phi(g) > 0$) at locations we want and that will simplify the integration. This may seem ad-hoc -- but remember we already made choices like not including 45° rotations. There do exist ways to systematically treat how to narrow the kernels into \"neigbhorhoods\" of groups in {cite}`finzi2020generalizing` or you can find a rigorous derivation specifically for p4 in {cite}`romero2020attentive` or {cite}`cohen2016group`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "I have a hidden cell below which does a bit of magic. It makes the group elements be hashable. That in turn allows me to cache functions, enabling much faster speeds. This code would be unusable otherwise due to all the nested loops.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for the p4m group is image data, so we'll limit the support of the kernel to only integer translations (like pixels) and limit the distance to 5 units. This simply reduces our sum over the normal subrgroup ($N$). We can now begin our implementation. We'll start by loading an image which will serve as our function. It is a $32\\times32$ RGB image. Remember that we need to allow points to have 3 dimensions, where the third dimension is always 1 to accommodate our augmented space."

    "## Group Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "p4m was an infinite group but we restricted ourselves to a finite subset. Before we can progress to move to truly infinite locally compact groups, like SO(3), we need to learn how to systematically represent the group element binary operation. You can find a detailed description of representation theory in Serre {cite}`serre1977linear` and it is covered in Zee {cite}`zee2016`. Thus far, we've discussed the group actions -- how they affect a point. Now we need to describe how to represent them with matrices. This will be a very quick overview of this topic, but representation of groups is a large area with well-established references. There is specifically a great amount of literature about building up these representations, but we'll try to focus on using them since you generally can look-up the representations for most groups we'll operate in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first define a representation on a group:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Linear Representation of a Group\n",
    "Let $G$ be a group on an $n$-dimensional vector space $\\mathcal{X}$ . A linear representation of $G$ is a group homomorphism: $\\rho: G \\rightarrow GL(m,\\mathbb{C})$ where $GL(m, \\mathbb{C})$ is the space of $m\\times m$ square invertible matrices with complex numbers. The representation $\\rho$ should satisfy the following equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\label{rep-def}\n",
    "\\rho\\left(g_1\\cdot g_2\\right) = \\rho\\left(g_1\\right) \\rho\\left(g_2\\right)\\; \\forall\\, g_1,g_2 \\in G\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the term $\\rho\\left(g_1\\right) \\rho\\left(g_2\\right)$ is a matrix product. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things to note about this definition. First, the representation assigns matrices to graph elements in such a way that multiplying matrices gives the same representation as getting the representation of the binary operation ($\\rho\\left(g_1\\cdot g_2\\right)$). Second, the matrices have to be square and invertible. This follows from the requirement that group elements must have an inverse, so naturally we need invertible matrices. The invertible requirement also means often need to allow complex numbers. Third, the **degree** of the representation ($m$) need not be the same size as the vector space. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a big detail missing from this definition. Does this have anything to do with how the group element affect a point? No. Consider that $\\rho(g_i) = 1$ is a valid representation, as in it satisfies the definition. Yet $1$ is not the correct way to transforms points with group elements. If we go further and say that the representation is *injective* (one to one), then we must have a unique representation for every group element. That is called a **faithful representation**. This is better, but it turns out there are still multiple faithful representations for a group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the way a group affects a point is a **group action**, which maps from the direct product of $G, \\mathcal{X}$ (i.e., a tuple like $(g_2, x)$ to $\\mathcal{X}$. A group action, if it is linear, can also be a representation. Consider that we write the group action $\\pi$ (how a group element affects a point) as $\\pi(g)(x) = x'$. You can convert this into a square matrix in $\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}$ by considering how each element of $x'$ is affected the element in $x$.

    "### Irreducible representations\n",
    "\n",
    "These representations that both describe the group action and how group elements affect on another are typically **reducible**, meaning if you drop the requirement that they also describe group action they can be simplified. The process of reducing representations is again a topic best left to other references {cite}`serre1977linear`. Each group will have multiple unitary irreducible representations (e.g., $\\phi(g) = 1$ is always a valid irreducible representation). The number of irreducible representations is finite for finite groups and an infnite sequence for locally compact groups. These irreducible representations are like orthonormal basis-functions or basis-vectors from Hilbert spaces. From the Peter-Weyl theorem, they specifically provide a complete basis-set for integrable ($L^2$) functions of the group. Recall, we can use lifting to move functions of our space to our group and thus the irreducible representations enable us to represent the functions as a (direct) sum of coefficients of these. One important attribute of irreducible representations is that they can be complex and if a group is non-abelian, some of them will be matrices. That means the individual representations can have different dimensions. Remember, each individual irreducible representation is itself a valid representation but they are not all faithful and so you need some of them to uniquely represent all group elements and all (?) of them to represent functions over the group. We'll discuss below why we would subject ourself to this confusing and seemingly capricious convention of working with irreducible representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a (countable) infinite sequence of possible irreducible representations for the SO(3) group known as the Wigner D-matrices. They must be of odd dimension, and so are traditionally written as the sequence $2l + 1$ where $l$ is an integer that serves as the irreducible representation index. The Wigner D-matrices are square with dimension $2l + 1$ and are a function of the group element (e.g., the angles of the rotation). This may be surprising, that the irreducible representations can be of greater dimension than our reducible representation $R_z(\\alpha)R_y(\\beta)R_z(\\gamma)$. The easiest way to think about this is to consider SO(3) acting on 3 dimensional $nth$ degree polynomials. The trivial representation works on 0th degree polynomials ($l = 0$), the 3 dimensional representation works on 1st degree polynomials ($l = 1$), the 5 dimensional representation works on 2nd degree polynomials ($l = 2$), and so on. You can find a nice description of [this here](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/40141). \n",
    "\n",
    "A sum of irreducible representations is how we encode our input function $f(x)$ into the group SO(3). The main reason we do this is because *convolutions of group functions are products of their irreducible representations*. We can replace all the convolutions in Equation 8.7 with products. This is critical, since in SO(3) convolutions require a series of spherical integrals. Removing the integrals means we can do training and inference with equivariant neural networks in SO(3) with existing deep learning frameworks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully at this point we have an understanding of representations, irreducible representations, and the point of them. Now we must discuss the numerical details. The first question is how we actually encode our input function into the irreducible representation. One way is via the generalization of the Fourier transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\hat{f}(\\rho_i) = \\int_G\\rho_i(u)f\\uparrow^G\\left(u\\right)d\\mu(u), \\; l=0,1,\\ldots,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the left side is now a sequence of scalars over $l$, like a usual Fourier transform, $\\rho_i(u)$ is the $l$th irreducible representation, and $d\\mu(u)$ is the Haar measure. The Haar measure for SO(3) in with our group representation ($R_zR_yR_z$) is $\\frac{1}{8\\pi^2}\\sin\\beta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What does this look like for a typical neural network input? Imagine our features are a single point (non-zero value) along the positive $x-axis$. Remember that an input to the SO(3) should lie on the unit sphere, so the point is $(1, 0 ,0)$. We have to convert this to a function, easy enough: $f(x, y, z) = \\delta(x - 1)$. Now we must lift this into our group using our stabilizer at the north pole: $f(g) = f\\left(R_z(\\alpha)R_y(\\beta)R_z(\\gamma)\\right) = \\delta(\\beta - \\pi / 2)\\delta(\\alpha)$. Note our lifted function cannot involve $\\gamma$ because of our convention of lifting with the stabilizer subgroup of the north pole. Now we can compute the integral with the irreducible representations in Equation X. For SO(3), these irreducible representations are the Wigner D-matrices which are square matrices. It would seem then that our output will be a series of square matrices of increasing dimension as $l$ increases. However, we only require the 0th column of this square matrix because the rest of the terms are zero (Appendix D {cite}`cohen2018spherical`). This yields $2l + 1$ non-zero terms which is how implementations and papers keep track of them. It turns out the 0th column of the Wigner D-matrices are the **spherical harmonics**!"

You can see how this approach is used in real models in {cite}`thomas2018tensor` and {cite}`batzner2021se3equivariant`. Another way this approach is used is to encode the edge inputs to a graph neural network with irreducible representations of distance between nodes; this gives you the permutation invariance of a graph neural network and spatial equivariance {cite}`klicpera2019directional`.

    "## Equivariant Neural Networks with Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Irreducible representations are a bit of hassle. You need to project your input to them, you can have problems with channels, they require custom implementations, and you need to choose were to truncate your irreducible representations because they are in principle infinite. An interesting way to avoid them is to instead work in the defining representation (dense matrix) and put equivariant constraints on your network weights. This approach is quite nice because the implementation is independent of the group. It also works for finite groups. Its disadvantage appears when we start getting large input spaces, like all the positions of a protein, because it replaces vectors of irreducible reps with matrices which means you have $M^2$ scaling where $M$ is the number of input points. Let's see an example of this approach via the library released by the authors called Equivariant MLP (`emlp`){cite}`finzi2021emlp`\n",

We can make a product group of SO(3) with $S_5$ to enable permtuation of the atom ordering. One detail is that we no longer will have 5 input features because our space is $5 \\times 3$ -- we need to always work with all points simultaneously. \n",

The output representation will be a member of the group SO(3)$\\times S_5$ and we will sum over the permutation group to get the dipole moment, which is only a member of SO(3) group. "

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Equivariant neural networks guarantee equivariance by construction for arbitrary groups, which removes the need to align trajectories, work in special coordinate systems, or use pairwise distances. \n",
    "* Equivariance can be achieved by parameter sharing or testing/training data augmentation, but here we focused on equivariant layers that can be composed into a neural network. \n",
    "* Equivariance requires definition of a group and homogeneous space. We must view our input data as functions and our models as operators that transform functions.\n",
    "* Finite groups can be treated with G-equivariant layers that have an additional sum across the number of group elements.\n",
    "* Infinite groups like SO(3) can be made finite by working with a direct sum (list of vectors) of the irreducible representations. This requires converting the input data though to the irreducible representation and there are complexities in non-linearities and implementations typically must be written per-group.\n",
    "* Constraint-based equivariant layers are flexible, general, and quick to implement but may not scale well with respect to size of input group or number of points.\n",
    "* Recent work has also shown you can put irreducible representation direct sums into the edges of graph neural networks, gaining input size independence, permutation invariance, and spatial equivariance in one model. "
