    "# Equivariant Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapter {doc}`data` discussed data transformation and network architecture decisions that can be made to make a neural network equivariant with respect to translation, rotation, and permutations. However, those ideas limit the expressibility of our networks and are constructed ad-hoc. Now we will take a more systematic approach to defining equivariances and prove that there is only one layer type that can preserve a given equivariance. The result of this section will be layers that can be equivariant with respect to any transform, even for more esoteric cases like points on a sphere or mirror operations. To achieve this, we will need tools from group theory, representation theory, harmonic analysis, and deep learning. Equivariant neural networks are part of a broader topic of **geometric deep learning**, which is learning with data that has some underlying geometric relationships. Geometric deep learning is thus a broad-topic and includes the \"5Gs\": grids, groups, graphs, geodesics, and gauges. However, you'll see papers with that nomenclature concentrated on point clouds (gauges), whereas graph learning and grids are usually called graph neural networks and convolutions neural networks respectively. \n",

That combination is explored in {doc}`molnets`. If you're always working with atoms/points in the same order, you can ignore permutation equivariance. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get too far, let me first try to talk you out of equivariant networks. The math required is advanced, especially because the theory of these is still in flux. There are five papers in the last few years that propose a general theory for equivariant networks and they each take a slightly different approach {cite}`finzi2020generalizing,cohen2019general,kondor2018generalization,lang2020wigner,finzi2021emlp`. It is also easy to make mistakes in implementations due to the complexity of the methods. You must also do some of the implementation details yourself, because general efficient implementations of groups is still not solved (although we are [getting close now for specifically SE(3)](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-se3-transformers-training-using-an-nvidia-open-source-model-implementation/)). You will also find that equivariant networks are not in general state of the art on point clouds -- although that is starting to change with recent benchmarks set in point cloud segmentation {cite}`wang2020equivariant`, molecular force field prediction {cite}`batzner2021se3equivariant`, molecular energy predictions {cite}`klicpera2020directional`, and 3D molecular structure generation {cite}`satorras2021en`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives to equivariant networks are to just invariant features as discussed in {doc}`data`. Another approach is training and testing augmentation. Both are powerful methods for many domains and are easy to implement {cite}`shorten2019survey`. You can find details in the {doc}`data` chapter. However, augmentation does not work for locally compact symmetry groups (e.g., SO(3)) --- so you cannot use them for rotationally equivariant data. You can do data transformations like discussed in {doc}`data` to avoid equivariance and only work with invariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why would you study this chapter? I think these ideas are important and incorporating the equivariant layers into other network architectures can dramatically reduce parameter numbers and increase training efficiency."

    "We have to lay some mathematical foundations before we can grasp the equations and details of equivariant networks. We'll start with a brief overview of group theory so we can define the principle of equivariance generally. Then we'll show how any equivariance can be enforced in a neural network via a generalization of convolutions. Then we'll visit representation theory to see how to encode groups into matrices.  Then we'll see how these convolutions can be more easily represented using the generalization of Fourier transforms. Finally, we'll examine some implementations. Throughout this chapter we'll see three examples that capture some of the different settings."

    "A group is a general object in mathematics. A group is a set of elements that can be combined in a binary operation whose output is another member of the group. The most common example are the integers. If you combine two integers in a binary operation, the output is another integer. Of course, it depends on the operation ($1 \\div 2$ does not give an integer), so specifically consider addition. Integers are not the example we care about though. We're interested in groups of **transformations** that move points in a space. Operations like rotation, scaling, mirroring, or translating of single points. As you read about groups here, remember that the elements of the groups are *not* numbers or points. The group elements are transformations that act on points in the space. Notice I'm being a bit nebulous on what the space is for now. Let's first define a group: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Group Definition\n",
    "A group $G$ is a set of elements (e.g., $\\{a, b, c, i, e\\}$) equipped with a binary operation ($a\\cdot{}b = c$) whose output is another group element and the following conditions are satisfied:\n",

    "```\n",

    "This is quite a bit of nice structure. We always have an inverse available. Applying the binary operations never accidentally leaves our group. One important property that is missing from this list is **commutativity**. In general, a group is not commutative so that $a\\cdot{}b \\neq b\\cdot{}a$. If the group does have this extra property, we call the group **abelian**. Another detail is how big the set is. It can indeed be infinite, which is why the integers or all possible rotations of rotations of points on a sphere can be represented as a group. One notational convenience we'll make is that the binary operation \"$\\cdot{}$\" will just be referred to as \"dot\" or sometimes multiplication if I get sloppy. The number of elements in a group $|G|$ is known as the **order**.\n",

If you started at $(1,1)$, you would get to $(-4,5)$ with $r\\cdot{}t_{3,4}$ and $(-2,5)$ with $t_{-3,4}$. To be correct for *any point*, we need a different group element. So the product $r\\cdot{}t_{3,4}$ actually cannot be a product but instead must be a group element.

It is called semidirect, instead of direct, because we can actually mix our group elements. The elements both act on points in the same space ($x,y$ plane), so this makes sense. Another condition is that we can only have a semidirect product when one subgroup is normal and the translation subgroup is the normal subgroup. It is coincidentally abelian, but these two properties are not always identical. This semidirect product group is called p4m.\n",

Notice that $D_4$ is not a normal subgroup of p4m. If you do an inverse translation, rotate, then do a translation you may not have something equivalent to a rotation. It may be strange that we're talking about the group p4m when we haven't yet described how it's defined (identity, inverse, binary op). We'll do that with the semidirect product and then we could go back and verify that the translations are a normal subgroup more rigorously.

Instead, we will construct a partitioning of $G$ into $|\\mathcal{X}|$ sets called a quotient space $G / H$ such that $|G / H| = |\\mathcal{X}|$. It turns out, there is a well-studied approach to arranging elements in a group called **cosets**. Constructing cosets is a two-step process. First we define a subgroup $H$. A **subgroup** means it is itself a group; it has identities and inverses. We cannot accidentally leave $H$, $h_1\\cdot{} h_2 \\in H$. For example, translation transformations are a subgroup because you cannot accidentally create a rotation when combining two translations. \n",

Cosets are not groups, they are definitely not closed or have inverses. What's the point of making all these cosets? Remember our goal is to partition $G$ into a bunch of smaller sets so that we have one for each point in $\\mathcal{X}$. Constructing cosets partitions $G$ for sure, but do we get enough?

    "How can we treat the p4m group? We cannot directly use the continuous convolution definition because the rotations/mirror subgroup is finite and we cannot use the finite convolution because the translation subgroup is locally compact (infinitely many elements). Instead, we will exploit the structure of the group: it is constructed via a semidirect product so each group element is a pair of elements. Namely we can rewrite Equation 8.6 using the constituent subgroups $N \\rtimes H$ and writing elements $g = hn, g^{-1} = n^{-1}h^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",

    "Now we must treat the fact that there are an infinite number of elements in $N$ (the translations). We can simply choose the kernel function ($\\omega$) to only have support ($\\omega(g) > 0$) at locations we want and that will simplify the integration. This may seem ad-hoc -- but remember we already made choices like not including 45° rotations. There do exist ways to systematically treat how to narrow the kernels into \"neigbhorhoods\" of groups in {cite}`finzi2020generalizing` or you can find a rigorous derivation specifically for p4 in {cite}`romero2020attentive` or {cite}`cohen2016group`.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal for the p4m group is image data, so we'll limit the support of the kernel to only integer translations (like pixels) and limit the distance to 5 units. This simply reduces our sum over the normal subgroup ($N$). We can now begin our implementation. We'll start by loading an image which will serve as our function. It is a $32\\times32$ RGB image. Remember that we need to allow points to have 3 dimensions, where the third dimension is always 1 to accommodate our augmented space."

    "p4m was an infinite group but we restricted ourselves to a finite subset. Before we can progress to truly infinite locally compact groups, like SO(3), we need to learn how to systematically represent the group element binary operation. You can find a detailed description of representation theory in Serre {cite}`serre1977linear` and it is covered in Zee {cite}`zee2016`. Thus far, we've discussed the group actions -- how they affect a point. Now we need to describe how to represent them with matrices. This will be a very quick overview of this topic, but representation of groups is a large area with well-established references. There is specifically a great amount of literature about building up these representations, but we'll try to focus on using them since you generally can look-up the representations for most groups we'll operate in. \n",

    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Linear Representation of a Group\n",
    "Let $G$ be a group on an $n$-dimensional vector space $\\mathcal{X}$ . A linear representation of $G$ is a group homomorphism: $\\rho: G \\rightarrow GL(m,\\mathbb{C})$ where $GL(m, \\mathbb{C})$ is the space of $m\\times m$ square invertible matrices with complex numbers. The representation $\\rho$ should satisfy the following equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\label{rep-def}\n",
    "\\rho\\left(g_1\\cdot g_2\\right) = \\rho\\left(g_1\\right) \\rho\\left(g_2\\right)\\; \\forall\\, g_1,g_2 \\in G\n",

    "where the term $\\rho\\left(g_1\\right) \\rho\\left(g_2\\right)$ is a matrix product. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things to note about this definition. First, the representation assigns matrices to group elements in such a way that multiplying matrices gives the same representation as getting the representation of the binary operation ($\\rho\\left(g_1\\cdot g_2\\right)$). Second, the matrices have to be square and invertible. This follows from the requirement that group elements must have an inverse, so naturally we need invertible matrices. The invertible requirement also means we often need to allow complex numbers. Third, the **degree** of the representation ($m$) need not be the same size as the vector space. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a big detail missing from this definition. Does this have anything to do with how the group element affect a point? No. Consider that $\\rho(g_i) = 1$ is a valid representation, as in it satisfies the definition. Yet $1$ is not the correct way to transforms points with group elements. If we go further and say that the representation is *injective* (one to one), then we must have a unique representation for every group element. That is called a **faithful representation**. This is better, but it turns out there are still multiple faithful representations for a group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the way a group affects a point is a **group action**, which maps from the direct product of $G, \\mathcal{X}$ (i.e., a tuple like $(g_2, x)$ to $\\mathcal{X}$). A group action, if it is linear, can also be a representation. Consider that we write the group action $\\pi$ (how a group element affects a point) as $\\pi(g)(x) = x'$. You can convert this into a square matrix in $\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{X}$ by considering how each element of $x'$ is affected the element in $x$. This matrix can be further shown to be in $GL(m, \\mathcal{X})$ and a representation by relying on its linearity. There isn't a special word for this, but often groups are defined in terms of these special matrices that both transforms points and are valid representations (e.g., SO(3)). They are then called the **defining representation** or **fundamental representation**. \n",

What is interesting about this notation is that each block is then *itself* a representation. We could just pick $\\rho_0(g)$ as a representation, and if this block structure is true for all $g$, then $\\rho_0(g_1)\\rho_0(g_2)$ should give back something with non-zero elements only in the rows/columns of the $\\rho_0(g)$ block. We could also combine $\\rho_0(g)$ and $\\rho_1(g)$ or even $\\rho_0(g)$ and $\\rho_2(g)$.

These are square matrices that have have an odd dimension, and so are traditionally written as the sequence $2l + 1 \\times 2l + 1$ where $l$ is an integer that serves as the irreducible representation index. The Wigner D-matrices are a function of the group element (e.g., the angles of the rotation). This may be surprising, that the irreducible representations can be of greater dimension than our reducible representation $R_z(\\alpha)R_y(\\beta)R_z(\\gamma)$. Of course, remember the matrix blocks we built above --- we can keep making these representations bigger. But do they have any intuitive meaning? One way to think about irreps larger than the fundamental representation is to consider SO(3) acting on 3 dimensional $n$th degree monomials rather than points: $x^iy^jz^k$ where $l = i + j + k$. The trivial representation works on the 0th degree monomial ($l = 0$), the $l = 1$ irrep has three possible monomials ($x, y, z$), the $l=2$ irrep has 5 possible monomials (excluding a redundant term) $x^2$, $y^2$, $z^2$, $xy$, $xz$. You can find a nice description of [this here](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/40141).\n",

    "The Wigner D-matrices are a representation of the group elements (rotations), so it has the properties of a representation. Using $D(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) = D(g)$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "D(g)D(g') = D(g\\cdot g')\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use the Wigner D-matrices directly (see discussion in {cite}`kondor2018clebsch`). However, when we lift our input function (input points) into the group, each point in our space maps to multiple group elements (the cosets discussed above). Instead of working with such redundant representation, we can work with spherical harmonics that give *vectors* instead of *matrices* for a particular choice of irrep index $l$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, remember our conversion from an input $f(x)$ to a linear combination of irreps $\\rho_k(g)$. Our input scalar function over points in space $\\mathcal{X}$ $f(x)$ is converted to a function over group via lifting $f\\uparrow^G(g)$, where $g$ is chosen such that $x = gx_0$. *There are multiple $g$'s that satisfy this equation (since we only need two Euler angles to get from the north pole $x_0$ to any other point).* $f\\uparrow^G(g)$ can be represented with a set of coefficients times the irreps $f\\uparrow^G(g)=\\sum_k\\vec{f}_k\\cdot\\rho_k(g)$ and those $\\rho_k (g)$ are the Wigner D-matrices. You can see there is some redundancy because the $\\rho_k (g)$ terms *must* represent all elements in $g$ and actually our life would be simpler to have multiple $g$'s give the same $\\rho_k(g)$ because $x = gx_0$ is satisfied by many $g$'s. We know our function should be insensitive to these multiple $g$'s since $f$ defined on points -- $f(x)$, not arbitrary group elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can we do here? We desire a set of $\\rho_k(g)$ that behave like irreps, are smaller than the D-matrices, and still form a basis set so we can represent any $f(x)$ as the liner combination $\\sum_k\\vec{f}_k\\cdot\\rho_k(g)$. Such a set of functions exists and is called the *spherical harmonics*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spherical harmonics, usually written as $Y_{lm}(\\beta, \\alpha)$, are a representation of the $G$ SO(3) and have similar properties to the Wigner D-matrices. Namely:\n",

How do we get from a point $x$ to a $g$ to plug into the $Y_{lm}(\\beta, \\alpha)$? Same as above - finding the rotation that would go from the stabilizer element $x_0 = (0,0,1)$ vector to the given point. Namely, finding the azimuthal and polar angle. The spherical harmonics can represent any function that acts on the space $f(x)$ and is also a representation for group elements, meaning we can use it in the G-equivariant convolution layers above.\n",

It's a choice, but usually you'll see networks encode a 3D point into the $l=1$ irrep because it's the smallest irrep that won't become invariant. This also allows a sort of separation of input features, where we can put scalar properties like mass or element into the $l = 0$ irrep and the point position into the $l=1$ irrep.

    "* Equivariance can be achieved by parameter sharing or testing/training data augmentation, but here we focused on equivariant layers that can be composed into a neural network. \n",
    "* Equivariance requires definition of a group and homogeneous space. We must view our input data as functions and our models as operators that transform functions.\n",
    "* Finite groups can be treated with G-equivariant layers that have an additional sum across the number of group elements.\n",
    "* Infinite groups like SO(3) can be made finite by working with a direct sum (list of vectors) of the irreducible representations. This requires converting the input data though to the irreducible representation and there are complexities in nonlinearities and implementations typically must be written per-group.\n",
    "* Constraint-based equivariant layers are flexible, general, and quick to implement but may not scale well with respect to size of input group or number of points.\n",
    "* Recent work has also shown you can put irreducible representation direct sums into the edges of graph neural networks, gaining input size independence, permutation invariance, and spatial equivariance in one model. "
