    "# Kernel Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel learning is a way to transform features in either classification or regression problems. Recall in regression, we have the following model equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\hat{y} = \\vec{w}\\vec{x} + b\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vec{x}$ is our feature vector of dimension $D$. In kernel learning, we transform our feature vector from dimension $D$ features to *distances to training data points* of dimension $N$, where $N$ is the number of training data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\hat{y} = \\sum_i^N w_i \\left<\\vec{x}, \\vec{x}_i\\right>+ b\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\left<\\cdot\\right>$ is distance between two feature vectors and $\\vec{x}_i$ is the $i$th training data point. $\\vec{x}$ is the function argument whereas $\\vec{x}_i$ are known values. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "Although we will use the word distance, the $\\left<\\cdot\\right>$ function is actually an inner product which is more flexible than a distance.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the consequences of this transformation is that our training weight vector, $\\vec{w}$, no longer depends on the number of features. **Instead the number of weights depends on the number of training data points.** This is the reason we use kernel learning. You might have few training data points but large feature vectors ($N < D$). By using the kernel formulation, you'll reduce the number of weights. It might also be that your feature space is hard to model with a linear equation, but when you view it as distances from training data it becomes linear (often $N > D$). Finally, it could be that your feature vector is infinite dimensional (i.e., it is a function not a vector) or for some reason you cannot compute it. In kernel learning, you only need to define your *kernel function*  $\\left<\\cdot\\right>$ and never explicitly work with the feature vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "The distance function is called a *kernel function*  $\\left<\\cdot\\right>$. A kernel function is a binary function (takes two arguments) that outputs a scalar and has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Positive: $\\left<x, x'\\right> \\geq 0$\n",
    "2. Symmetric: $\\left<x, x'\\right> = \\left<x', x \\right>$\n",
    "3. Point-separating: $\\left<x, x'\\right> = 0$ if and only if $x = x'$\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic kernel function example is $l_2$ norm (Euclidean distance): $\\left<\\vec{x}, \\vec{x}'\\right>=\\sqrt{\\sum^D_i (x_i - x_i^{'})^2}$. Some of the most interesting applications of kernel learning though are when $x$ is not a vector, but a function or some other structured object. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Primal & Dual Form\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "**Dual Form** is what some call our model equation when it uses the kernels: $\\hat{y} = \\sum_i^N w_i \\left<\\vec{x}, \\vec{x}_i\\right>+ b$. To distinguish from the dual form, you can also refer to the usual model equation as the **Primal Form**  $\\hat{y} = \\vec{w}\\vec{x} + b$. It also sounds cool. \n",

In contrast to the functions we see in deep learning, we can use sophisticated and non-differentiable functions in kernel learning. For example, you could use a binary molecular dynamics simulation to compute the kernel between two molecules.  We'll still implement our kernel functions in JAX for this example because it is efficient and consistent. Remember our kernel should take two feature vectors and return a scalar. In our example, we will simply use the $l_2$ norm. I will add one small twist though: dividing by the dimension.

If we were to use a direct computation of the fit coefficients with a pseudo-inverse, we could run into problems because of this. Thus, most people add an additional regularization term to both make matrix algebra solutions tractable and because it seems wise with the large number of trainable parameters. Just like we saw in linear regression, L1 regression is known as **Lasso Ridge Regression** and L2 is known as **Kernel Ridge Regression**. Remember that L1 zeros-out specific parameters which was useful for interpreting the importance of features in linear regression. However, in the kernel setting this would only zero-out specific training data points and thus provides no real insight(usually, see {doc}`../dl/xai`). Kernel ridge regression is thus more popular in the kernel setting."

    "The bias-variance trade-off from {doc}`../ml/regression` showed how increasing model complexity could reduce model bias (more expressive and able to fit data better) at the cost of increased model variance (more sensitive to training data choice and amount). The model complexity was controlled by adjusting feature number. In kernel learning, we cannot control feature number because it is always equal to the number of training data points. Thus, we can only control hyperparameters like the choice of kernel, regularization, learning rate, etc. To assess these effects, we usually do not only compute test loss because that is highly-connected to the amount of training data you have. More training data means more sophisticated models and thus lower loss. So it is common in kernel learning especially to show how the test-loss changes a function of training data amount. These are presented as log-log plots due to the large magnitude changes in these. These are called **training curves** (or sometimes **learning curves**). Training curves can be applied broadly in ML and deep learning, but you'll most often see them in kernel learning.\n",

    "* In this section we introduced kernel learning, which is a method to transform features into distance between samples.\n",
    "* A kernel function takes two arguments and outputs a scalar. A kernel function must have three properties: positive, symmetric, and point-separating.\n",
    "* The distance function (inner product) is a kernel function.\n",
    "* Kernel functions do not need to be differentiable.\n",
    "* The number of trainable parameters in a kernel model is proportional to number of training points, not dimension of features."
