    "# Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is supervised learning with categorical labels. You are given labeled data consisting of features and labels $\\{\\vec{x}_i, \\vec{y}_i\\}$, where $\\vec{y}_i$ is a vector of binary values indicating class membership. An example of $\\vec{y}_i$ that indicates membership of classes \"soluble in THF\", \"insoluble in water\", \"soluble in chloroform\" might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  THF  | water | chloroform |\n",
    "|:------|:-----:| ----------:|\n",
    "|   1   |   0   |   1        |\n",
    "\n",
    "where we've indicated that the molecule in soluble in THF and chloroform but not water. As a vector, it is $\\vec{y} = (1, 0, 1) $.  This is the general format of classification and can be called **multi-label** classification because we are attaching three labels: THF soluble, water insoluble, chloroform soluble. This can be restricted so that each data point belongs to only one class -- called **multi-class** classification. This might be like assigning visible color. A molecule can only be red or green or orange, but not multiple colors. Finally, you can only have one class and a label can only belong to the single class or does not belong to the single class. This is called **binary** classification and is the most common classification type. If you're doing multi-label or multi-class classification, the shape of $\\vec{y}$ will be a vector length $K$ where $K$ indicates number of classes. In the case of binary classification, the label is a binary value of 1 or 0 where 1 means it is a member of the class. You can view this as there being two classes: a **positive** class ($y = 1$) and **negative** class ($y = 0$). For example, you could be predicting if a molecule will kill cells. If the molecule is in the positive class, it kills cells. If it is the negative class, it is inert and does not kill cells. Depending on your choice of model type, when you predict the labels ($\\hat{\\vec{y}}$), your model could predict probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "Note that in multi-class and binary classification $\\sum \\hat{\\vec{y}} = 1$, but \n",
    "in multi-label classification this is not the case. Multi-label classification is like doing $K$ instances of binary classification. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of classification is to find a function that describes the relationship between features and class, $\\hat{f}(\\vec{x}) = \\hat{y}$. We'll see that this problem can be converted to regression by using probability or *distance from  a decision boundary*. This means much of what we learned previously can be applied to this classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic application of classification in structure-activity relationship is in drug discovery, where we want to predict if a molecule will be active (positive class) as a function of structure. That dates back to the 1970s. Classification is widely used now in materials and chemistry. Many molecular design problems can be formulated as classification. For example, you can use it to design new organic photovoltaic materials {cite}`sun2019machine` or antimicrobial peptides {cite}`barrett2018classifying`."

    "The dataset for this lecture was prepared by the MoleculeNet group {cite}`wu2018moleculenet`.  It is a collection of molecules that succeeded or failed in clinical trials. The development of a new drug can cost well over a $1 billion, so any way to predict if a molecule will fail during clinical trials is highly valuable. The reason molecules fail in clinical trials is often due to safety, so even though some of these drugs failed because they were not effective there may be something common to each of the failed ones that we can learn.\n",

We're going to add one complexity -- **threshold**. Our model provides probabilities which we're converting into hard class memberships -- 1s and 0s. We have been choosing to just take the most probable class. However, we will now instead choose a threshold for when we report a positive (class 1). The rationale is that although we train our model to minimize cross-entropy, we may want to be more conservative or aggressive in our classification with the trained model. If we want to minimize false negatives, we can lower the threshold and report even predictions that have a probability of 30% as positive. Or, if we want to minimize false positives we may set our threshold so that our model must predict above 90% before we predict a positive."

    "\n",
    "The reason for this uneven amount of false positives and false negatives is that we have very few negative example -- molecules which failed FDA clinical trials. This also explains why just predicting success has a high accuracy. How can we address this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first answer is do nothing. Is this imbalance a problem at all? Perhaps a drug in general will succeed at clinical trials and thus the imbalance in training data reflects what we expect to see in testing. This is clearly not the case, judging from the difficult and large expense of creating new drug molecules. However, this should be the first thing you ask yourself. If you're creating a classifier to detect lung cancer from X-ray images, probably you will have imbalanced training data and at test time, when evaluating patients, you'll also not have 50% of patients having lung cancer. This comes back to the discussion in the [previous chapter](content:training-tata-distribution) about training data distribution. If your testing data is within your training data distribution, then the class imbalance does not need to be explicitly addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second solution is to somehow weight your training data to appear more like your testing data when you think you do have **label shift**. There are two ways to accomplish this. You could \"augment\" your training data by repeating the minority class until the ratio of minority to majority examples matches the assumed testing data. There are research papers written on this topic, with intuitive results{cite}`chawla2002smote`. You can over-sample minority class but that can lead to a large dataset, so you can also under-sample the majority class. This is a robust approach that is independent to how you train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method of weighing data is to modify your loss function to increase the gradient updates applied to minority examples. This is equivalent to saying there is a difference in loss between a false positive vs a false negative. In our case, false positive are rarer and also more important in reality. We would rather skip a clinical trial (false negative) rather than start one and have it fail (false positive). We already tried minimizing false positives by changing the threshold on a trained model but let's see how this works during training. We'll create a weight vector that is high for negative labels so that if they are misclassified (false positive), there will be a bigger update.\n"
