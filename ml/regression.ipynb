    "# Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is supervised learning with continuous (or sometimes discrete) labels. You are given labeled data consisting of features and labels $\\{\\vec{x}_i, y_i\\}$. The goal is to find a function that describes their relationship, $\\hat{f}(\\vec{x}) = \\hat{y}$. This lecture introduces some probability theory, especially expectations. You can get a refresher of [probability of random variables](https://whitead.github.io/numerical_stats/) and/or [expections](https://whitead.github.io/numerical_stats/unit_4/lectures/lecture_2.pdf). We also use and discuss [linear regression techniques](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/whitead/numerical_stats/blob/master/unit_12/lectures/lecture_1.ipynb#Extending-Least-Squares-to-Multiple-Dimensions-in-Domain---OLS-ND). A more formal discussion of the concepts discussed here can be found in Chapter 3 of Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning{cite}`bishop2006pattern`."

    "We'll be working again with the AqSolDB{cite}`Sorkun2019` dataset. It has about 10,000 unique compounds with measured solubility in water (label) and 17 molecular descriptors (features). We need to create a better assessment of our supervised ML models. The goal of our ML model is to predict solubility of new unseen molecules. Therefore, to assess we should test on unseen molecules. We will split our data into two subsets: **training data** and **testing data**. Typically this is done with an 80%/20%, so that you train on 80% of your data and test on the remaining 20%. In our case, we'll just do 50%/50% because we have plenty of data and thus do not need to take 80% for training. We'll be using a subset, 50 molecules chosen randomly, rather than the whole dataset. So we'll have 50 training molecules and 50 testing molecules.\n",

However, the testing loss goes down and then starts to go back up. This is called **overfitting**. This is one of the key challenges in ML and we'll often be discussing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is a result of training for too many steps or with too many parameters, resulting in our model learning the **noise** in the training data. The noise is specific for the training data and when computing loss on the test data there is poor performance. \n",

    "To understand this, let's first define noise. Assume that there is a \"perfect\" function $f(\\vec{x})$ that can compute labels from features. Our model is an estimate $\\hat{f}(\\vec{x})$ of that function. Even $f(\\vec{x})$ will not reproduce the data exactly because our features do not capture everything that goes into solubility and/or there is error in the solubility measurements themselves. Mathematically,\n",

When fitting our function, $\\hat{f}(\\vec{x})$, the noise is fixed because our labels $y$ are fixed. That means we can accidentally learn to approximate the sum of $f(\\vec{x})$ and the noise ${\\epsilon_i}$ instead of only capturing $f(\\vec{x})$. The noise is random and uncorrelated with solubility. When we move to our testing dataset, this noise changes because we have new data and our model's effort to reproduce noise is useless because the new data has new noise. This leads to worse performance. \n",

    "Overfitting arises when three things happen: you have noise, you have extra features or some part of your features are not correlated with the labels, and your training has converged (your model fit is at the global minimum). This last one is what we saw above. Our model wasn't overfit after about 100 steps (the training and testing loss were both decreasing), but then they starting going in opposite directions. Let's see how these things interplay to lead to overfitting in an example where we can exactly control the features and noise. "

    "## Exploring Effect of Feature Number\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that overfitting is sensitive to the number and choice of features. Feature selection is a critical decision in supervised learning. We'll return to the solubility dataset to discuss this. It has 17 molecular descriptors, but these are just a small fraction of the possible molecular descriptors that can be used. For example, there is a software called [Dragon](https://chm.kode-solutions.net/products_dragon.php) that can compute over 5,000 descriptors. You can also create linear combinations of descriptors and pass them through functions. Then there is the possibility of experimental data, data from molecular simulations, and from quantum calculations. There is essentially an unlimited number of possible molecular descriptors. We'll start this chapter by exploring what effect of number of features (dimension of features) has on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "**Descriptor** is chemistry and materials specific word for feature. It pre-dates the word features and comes from the field of \"qauntitative-structure activity relationship\" (QSAR), which has a long history in drug design and molecular design.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now working with a real dataset, which means there is randomness from which features we choose, which training data we choose, and randomness in the labels themselves. In the results below, they are averaged over possible features and possible training data splits to deal with this. Thus the code is complex. You can see it on the Github repository, but I've omitted it here for simplicity.\n",

    "{numref}`small_feature_number` shows the effect of choosing different features on both the loss on training data and the loss on test data. There are three regimes in this plot. At 1-3 features, we are **underfit** meaning both the training and testing losses could be improved with more features or more training. In this case, it is because there are too few features. Until about 10 features, we see that adding new features slightly improves training data but doesn't help test data meaning we're probably slightly overfitting. Then at 10, there is a large increase as we move to the overfit regime. Finally at about 30 features, our model is no longer converging and training loss rises because it is too difficult to train the increasingly complex model. \"Difficult\" here is a relative term; you can easily train for more time on this simple model but this is meant as an example. \n",

    "{numref}`large_feature_number` shows the same analysis but for 250 train and 250 test data. The accuracy on test data is better (about 1.9 vs 2.5). There is not much overfitting visible here. The model is clearly underfit until about 10 features and then each additional feature has little effect. Past 20 features, we again see an underfit because the model is not trained well. This could fixed by adding more training steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing feature numbers is useful up to a certain point. Although some methods are unstable when the number of features is exactly the same as the number of data points, there is reason overfitting begins at or near feature numbers equal to the number of data points. Overfitting can disappear at large feature numbers because of model size and complexity. Here there is also a risk of underfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of overfitting is lower as your dataset size increases. The reason for this is that the noise becomes smaller than the effect of labels on training as you increase data points. Recall from the Central Limit Theorem that reducing noise by a factor of 10 requires 100 times more data, so this is not as efficient as choosing better features. Thinking about these trade-offs, to double your feature number you should quadruple the number of data points to reduce the risk of overfitting. Thus there is a strong relationship between how complex your model can be, the achievable accuracy, the data required, and the noise in labels. "

    "### k-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias--variance decomposition shows that our testing error is sensitive to what training data has been chosen. The expected mean test error $E\\left[\\left(y - \\hat{f}(\\vec{x})\\right)^2\\right]$ depends on the label noise **and** the way we split our data into training and testing data. Thus far, we've only gotten a single sample from this expectation by splitting. One way to better estimate the value on unseen data is to repeat the process of splitting data into training and testing multiple times. This is called **k-fold** cross-validation, where $k$ is the number of times you repeat the process. k-fold cross-validation is useful because certain high-variance model choices can give different testing errors depending on the train/test split. k-fold also provides multiple samples so that you can estimate the **uncertainty** in testing error. As all things to do with model variance, the smaller the dataset the more important this is. Typically with very large datasets k-fold cross-validation is not done because label noise dominates and testing a model k times can be time-consuming. \n",
    "\n",
    "k-fold cross-validation has a specific process for splitting testing and training data. What we did previously was split into a 50/50 split of training and testing. In k-fold, we split our data into k segments. Then we train on k-1 segments and test on the last segment. You can do this k-ways. For example, with K = 3 you would split your data into A, B, C. The first train/test split would be A, B for training and C for testing. Then B, C for training and A for testing. The last would be A, C for training and B for testing. Following this procedure means that your percentage split will be 90/10 for $k = 10$ and 50/50 for $k = 2$. This has a disadvantage that the number of estimates for testing error depends on size of train/test split. For example, you cannot get 10 estimates for an 80/20 split. An 80/20 split means exactly 5-fold cross-validation. We'll see other methods that relax this later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now use k-fold cross-validation in two examples: our full dataset and a smaller 25 data point sample. Rather than using gradient descent here, we'll just use the pseudo-inverse to keep our code simple. "

We'll call this point the **prediction point** and we'll try to estimate the quantiles of this point. Quantiles are the building blocks for confidence intervals.

Instead, we'll use a method called **bootstrap resampling** which removes the restriction that we can only use $1 - 1 / k$ of the training data. Bootstrap resampling is a general process for estimating uncertainty for empirical statistics without assuming a probability distribution (i.e., non-parametric). In bootstrap resampling, we create as many as desired new training datasets that are the same size as the original by sampling **with replacement** from the original dataset. That means our new dataset has fewer members than the original and makes up the difference with duplicates. Let's see an example.

The first is that we need to produce and keep 100 models, one for each bootstrap resample. Of course you could choose fewer, but you need to have enough for good statistics. Another issue is that this process does not give a reportable test error. We could further split our data again and do k-fold cross-validation on this approach to get test error. However, this is a bit overly complex and then we'll be at a similar problem that we'll have k sets of 100 models and it's not obvious how to combine them.

    "##  Training Data Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "We have come a long ways now. We're able to compute test error, identify overfitting, understand model bias and variance, and predict uncertainty on unseen data points. One of the implied assumptions so far is that our splitting of data into training and testing data mimics what it will be like to predict on an unseen data point. More specifically, we assume that testing data comes from the same probability distribution as our training data. This is true when we're doing the splitting, but is often violated when we actually get new data to make predictions with. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are specific categories for how we have left the training distribution. **Covariate shift** is when the distribution of features changes. Covariate is another word for features. An example might be that the molecular weights of your molecules are larger in your testing data. The relationship between features and labels, $f(\\vec{x})$ remains the same, but the distribution of features is different. **Label shift** means that we have the distribution of labels has changed. Perhaps our training data was all very soluble molecules but at test time, we're examining mostly insoluble molecules. Again, our fundamental relationship  $f(\\vec{x})$ that we try to estimate with our model still holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common reasons unseen data can be out of the training data distribution. The first is that you are extrapolating to new regions of chemical space. For example, you have training data of drug activities. You make a model that can predict activity. What do you do with the model? You obviously find the highest activity drug molecule. However, this molecule is likely to be unusual and not in your training data. If it was in your training data you would probably already be done -- namely, you already synthesized and found a molecule with very high activity. Thus you will be pushing your model to regions outside of your training data. Another reason you can be out of training data is that the way you generated training data is different than how the model is used. For example, perhaps you trained on molecules that do not contain fluorine. Then you try your model on molecules that contain fluorine. Your features will be different than what you observed in training. The result of leaving your training data distribution is that your test error increases and the estimates you provide will be too low. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Leave One Class Out Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus understanding and assessing training data distribution is an important task. In general, standard models that minimize a loss are poor at predicting extreme values. We will approach this challenge later with specific methods like black-box function optimization. For now, be wary of using your models as tools to find extreme values. The second challenge, that you're leaving your training data due to how points are generated, can be assessed by computing a more realistic estimate of model error. Namely, your training data is typically gathered (generated) according to a different process than when your model is deployed at test time. This is generalization error, sometimes called **covariate shift**, and we sometimes wish to approximate its effect by simulating different training and testing distributions. This leads us to **leave one class out cross-validation** (LOCOCV). \n",
    "\n",
    "In LOCOCV, we must first assign a class to each training data point. This is domain specific. It could be based on the molecule. You could use a clustering method. In our case, our solubility data actually is a combination of five other datasets so our data is already pre-classified based on who measured the solubility. We will now perform a kind of k-fold cross-validation, leaving one class out at a time and assessing model error. We'll compare this to k-fold cross-validation without classes. \n"

    "* Overfitting causes a mismatch between training and testing error\n",
    "* Overfitting can be understood via the bias-variance decomposition\n",
    "* Increasing model complexity can improve fit (reduce bias), but increases model variance and thus test error\n",
    "* Regularization is a strategy to decrease model variance. L2 is a good first choice\n",
    "* More rigorous assessment of models can be done via k-fold cross-validation or Jacknife+ when the training data is small enough that we can train multiple models\n",
    "* Much of our model assessments depends on the testing data being from the same distribution as the training data (similar values). This is often not true and can be measured with leave-one-class-out cross-validation.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. What happens if we have redundant features but no noise? Is it possible to overfit?\n",
    "2. We said that increasing dataset size reduces model variance. Show this by using k-fold cross-validation on a few different dataset sizes. \n",

    "### Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement L1 regularization on the solubility data with $N = 35$ data points. Increase the strength until some features go to zero. Which ones are they? Why do you think they go to zero first?\n",
    "2. Repeat 1 with a few different sets of training data. Are your results consistent on which features disappear? Based on your results, do you think there is meaning to the features which go to zero?\n",
    "3. Implement the L-infinity (supremum norm) regularization, which returns the absolute value of the maximum element only.\n",
