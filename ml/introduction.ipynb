We'll see this supervised/unsupervised distinction can be more subtle later on, but this is a great definition for now. \n",

The randomness makes it possible to escape local minima that might stop training progress.

    "The reason the loss is lower is because we're able to take more steps even though we only see each data point once. That's because we update at each batch, giving more updates per iteration over the dataset. Specifically if $B$ is batch size, there are $N / B$ updates for every 1 update in the original gradient descent. The reason the loss doesn't always go down is that each time we evaluate it, it's on a different set of data. Some structures are harder to predict than others. Also, each step we take in minimizing loss may not be correct because we only updated our parameters based on one batch. Assuming our batches are mixed though, we will always improve in expectation (on average). "

    "2. Use rdkit to draw the 2 highest molecular weight molecules. Note they look strange. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prove that a non-linear model like $y = \\vec{w_1} \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\vec{w_2} \\cdot\\vec{x}\\right) + \\vec{w_3} \\cdot \\vec{x} + b$ could be represented as a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write out the linear model equation in Einstein notation in batched form. **Batched form** means we explicitly have an index indicating batch. For example, the labels will be $y_{bi}$  where $b$ indicates the batch of data and $i$ indicates the individual data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimizing Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We standardized the features, but not the labels. Would standardizing the labels affect our choice of learning rate? Prove your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement a loss that is mean absolute error, instead of mean squared error. Compute its gradient using `jax`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the standardized features, show what effect batch size has on training. Use batch sizes of 1, 8, 32, 256, 1024. Make sure you re-initialize your weights in between each run. Plot the log-loss for each batch size on the same plot. Describe your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We say that clustering is a type of unsupervised learning and that it predicts the labels. What exactly are the predicted labels in clustering? Write down what the predicted labels might look like for a few data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In clustering, we predict labels from features. You can still cluster if you have labels, by just pretending they are features. Give two reasons why it would not be a good idea to do clustering in this manner, where we treat the labels as features and try to predict new labels that represent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. On the isomap plot (reduced dimension plot), color the points by which group they fall in (G1, G2, etc.). Is there any relationship between this and the clustering?\n"
