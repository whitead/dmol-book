    "## Representing a Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph $\\mathbf{G}$ is a set of nodes $\\mathbf{V}$ and edges $\\mathbf{E}$. In our setting, node $i$ is defined by a vector $\\vec{v}_i$, so that the set of nodes can be written as a rank 2 tensor. The edges can be represented as an adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{E}$, where if $e_{ij} = 1$ then nodes $i$ and $j$ are connected by an edge. In many fields, graphs are often immediately simplified to be directed and acyclic, which simplifies things. Molecules are instead undirected and have cycles (rings). Thus, our adjacency matrices are always symmetric $e_{ij} = e_{ji}$ because there is no concept of direction in chemical bonds. Often our edges themselves have features, so that $e_{ij}$ is itself a vector. Then the adjacency matrix becomes a rank 3 tensor. Examples of edge features might be covalent bond order or distance between two nodes.\n",

    "### A simple GNN\n",
    "\n",
    "We will often mention a GNN when we really mean a layer from a GNN. Most GNNs implement a specific layer that can deal with graphs, and so usually we are only concerned with this layer. Let's see an example of a simple layer for a GNN:\n",

    "f_k = \\sigma\\left( \\sum_i \\sum_j v_{ij}w_{jk}  \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation shows that we first multiply every node ($v_{ij}$) feature by trainable weights $w_{jk}$, sum over all node features, and then apply an activation. This will yield a single feature vector for the graph. Is this equation permutation invariant? Yes, because the node index in our expression is index $i$ which can be re-ordered without affecting the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example that is similar, but not permutation invariant:\n",

    "This is a small change. We have one weight vector per node now. This makes the trainable weights depend on the ordering of the nodes. Then if we swap the node ordering, our weights will no longer align. So if we were to input two methanol molecules, which should have the same output, but we switched two atom numbers, we would get different answers. These simple examples differ from real GNNs in two important ways: (i) they give a single feature vector output, which throws away per-node information, and (ii) they do not use the adjacency matrix. Let's see a real GNN that has these properties while maintaining permutation invariance --- or equivariance (swapping inputs swaps outputs the same way)."

    "One of the first popular GNNs was the Kipf & Welling graph convolutional network (GCN) {cite}`kipf2016semi`. Although some people consider GCNs to be a broad class of GNNs, we'll use GCNs to refer specifically the Kipf & Welling GCN. \n",
    "Thomas Kipf has written an [excellent article introducing the GCN](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to a GCN layer is $\\mathbf{V}$, $\\mathbf{E}$ and it outputs an updated $\\mathbf{V}'$. Each node feature vector is updated. The way it updates a node feature vector is by averaging the feature vectors of its neighbors, as determined by $\\mathbf{E}$. The choice of averaging over neighbors is what makes a GCN layer permutation equivariant. Averaging over neighbors is not trainable, so we must add trainable parameters. We multiply the neighbor features by a trainable matrix before the averaging, which gives the GCN the ability to learn. In Einstein notation, this process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v_{il} = \\sigma\\left(\\frac{1}{d_i}e_{ij}v_{jk}w_{kl}\\right)\n",
    "$$ (gcn)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ is the node we're considering, $j$ is the neighbor index, $k$ is the node input feature, $l$ is the output node feature, $d_i$ is the degree of node i (which makes it an average instead of sum), $e_{ij}$ isolates neighbors so that all non-neighbor $v_{jk}$s are zero, $\\sigma$ is our activation, and $w_{lk}$ is the trainable weights. This equation is a mouthful, but it truly just is the average over neighbors with a trainable matrix thrown in. One common modification is to make all nodes neighbors of themselves. This is so that the output node features $v_{il}$ depends on the input features $v_{ik}$. We do not need to change our equation, just make the adjacency matrix have $1$s on the diagonal instead of $0$ by adding the identity matrix during pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building understanding about the GCN is important for understanding other GNNs. You can view the GCN layer as a way to \"communicate\" between a node and its neighbors. The output for node $i$ will depend only on its immediate neighbors. For chemistry, this is not satisfactory. You can stack multiple layers though. If you have two layers, the output for node $i$ will include information about node $i$'s neighbors' neighbors. Another important detail to understand in GCNs is that the averaging procedure accomplishes two goals: (i) it gives permutation equivariance by removing the effect of neighbor order and (ii) it prevents a change in magnitude in node features. A sum would accomplish (i) but would cause the magnitude of the node features to grow after each layer. Of course, you could ad-hoc put a batch normalization layer after each GCN layer to keep output magnitudes stable but averaging is easy."

Examples of changes to the above GCN equations are to include edge information when computing the neighbor messages or use a dense neural network layer in place of $\\sigma$.

In a GGN, the GRU parameters are kept the same at each layer, like how a GRU is used to model sequences. What's nice about this is that you can stack infinite GGN layers without increasing the number of trainable parameters (assuming you make $\\mathbf{W}$ the same at each layer).

    "## Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the message passing viewpoint, and in general for GNNS, the way that messages from neighbors are combined is a key step. This is sometimes called **pooling**, since it's similar to the pooling layer used in convolutional neural networks. Just like in pooling for convolutional neural networks, there are multiple reduction operations you can use. Typically you see a sum or mean reduction in GNNs, but you can be quite sophisticated like in the Graph Isomorphism Networks {cite}`xu2018powerful`. We'll see an example in our attention chapter of using self-attention, which can also be used for pooling. It can be tempting to focus on this step, but it's been empirically found that the choice of pooling is not so important{cite}`luzhnica2019graph,mesquita2020rethinking`. The key property of the pooling is permutation *invariance* - we want the aggregation operation to not depend on order of nodes (or edges if pooling over them). You can find a recent review of pooling methods in Grattarola et al. {cite}`grattarola2021understanding`.\n",

    "\n",
    "GNNs output a graph by design. It is rare that our labels are graphs -- typically we have node labels or a single graph label. An example of a node label is partial charge of atoms. An example of a graph label would be the energy of the molecule. The process of converting the graph output from the GNN into our predicted node labels or graph label is called the **readout**. If we have node labels, we can simply discard the edges and use our output node feature vectors from the GNN as the prediction, perhaps with a few dense layers before our predicted output label.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're trying to predict a graph-level label like energy of the molecule or net charge, we need to be careful when converting from node/edge features to a graph label. If we simply put the node features into a dense layer to get to the desired shape graph label, we will lose permutation equivariance (technically it's permutation invariance now since our output is graph label, not node labels). The readout we did above in the solubility example was a reduction over the node features to get a graph feature. Then we used this graph feature in dense layers. It turns out this is the only way {cite}`zaheer2017deep` to do a graph feature readout: a reduction over nodes to get graph feature and then dense layers to get predicted graph label from those graph features. You can also do some dense layers on the node features individually, but that already happens in GNN so I do not recommend it. This readout is sometimes called DeepSets because it is the same form as the DeepSets architecture, which is a permutation invariant architecture for features that are sets{cite}`zaheer2017deep`.\n",

    "### Intensive vs Extensive\n",
    "\n",
    "One important consideration of a readout in regression is if your labels are **intensive** or **extensive**. An intensive label is one whose value is independent of the number of nodes (or atoms). For example, the index of refraction or solubility are intensive. The readout for an intensive label should (generally) be independent of the number of a nodes/atoms. So the reduction in the readout could be a mean or max, but not a sum. In contrast, an extensive label should (generally) use a sum for the reduction in the readout. An example of an extensive molecular property is enthalpy of formation. "

    "## Battaglia General Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, message passing layers is a general way to view GNN layers. Battaglia *et al.* {cite}`battaglia2018relational` went further and created a general set of equations which captures nearly all GNNs. They broke the GNN layer equations down into 3 update equations, like the node update equation we saw in the message passing layer equations, and 3 aggregation equations (6 total equations). There is a new concept in these equations: graph feature vectors. Instead of having two parts to your network (GNN then readout), a graph level feature is updated at every GNN layer. The graph feature vector is a set of features which represent the whole graph or molecule. For example, when computing solubility it may have been useful to build up a per-molecule feature vector that is eventually used to compute solubility instead of having the readout. Any kind of per-molecule quantity, like energy, should be predicted with the graph-level feature vector. \n",

In our molecular graph, all bonds are both \"inputs\" and \"outputs\" from an atom (how else could it be?), so it makes sense to just view every bond as two directed edges: a C-H bond has an edge from C to H and an edge from H to C. In fact, our adjacency matrices already reflect that. There are two non-zero elements in them for each bond: one for C to H and one for H to C. Back to the original question, what is $\\vec{v}_{rk}$ and $\\vec{v}_{sk}$? We consider every element in the adjacency matrix (every $k$) and when we're on element $k = \\{ij\\}$, which is $A_{ij}$, then the receiving node is $j$ and the sending node is $i$.

Thus, we need to first see how a set of atoms and their positions is converted into a graph. To get the nodes, we do a similar process as above and the atomic number is passed through an embedding layer, which just means we assign a trainable vector to each atomic number (See {doc}`layers` for a review of embeddings). \n",

    "We've now seen message passing layer GNNs, GCNs, GGNs, and the generalized Battaglia equations. You'll find common motifs in the architectures, like gating, {doc}`attention`, and pooling strategies. For example, Gated GNNS (GGNs) can be combined with attention pooling to create Gated Attention GNNs (GAANs){cite}`zhang2018gaan`. GraphSAGE is similar to a GCN but it samples when pooling, making the neighbor-updates of fixed dimension{cite}`hamilton2017inductive`. So you'll see the suffix \"sage\" when you sample over neighbors while pooling. These can all be represented in the Battaglia equations, but you should be aware of these names. \n",
    "\n",
    "The enormous variety of architectures has led to work on identifying the \"best\" or most general GNN architecture {cite}`dwivedi2020benchmarking,errica2019fair,shchur2018pitfalls`. Unfortunately, the question of which GNN architecture is best is as difficult as \"what benchmark problems are best?\" Thus there are no agreed-upon conclusions on the best architecture. However, those papers are great resources on training, hyperparameters, and reasonable starting guesses and I highly recommend reading them before designing your own GNN. There has been some theoretical work to show that simple architectures, like GCNs, cannot distinguish between certain simple graphs {cite}`xu2018powerful`. How much this practically matters depends on your data. Ultimately, there is so much variety in hyperparameters, data equivariances, and training decisions that you should think carefully about how much the GNN architecture matters before exploring it with too much depth.

    "### Nodes, Edges, and Features\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll find that most GNNs use the node-update equation in the Battaglia equations but do not update edges. For example, the GCN will update nodes at each layer but the edges are constant. Some recent work has shown that updating edges can be important for learning when the edges have geometric information, like if the input graph is a molecule and the edges are distance between the atoms {cite}`klicpera2019directional`. As we'll see in the chapter on equivariances ({doc}`../dl/data`), one of the key properties of neural networks with point clouds (i.e., Cartesian xyz coordinates) is to have rotation equivariance. {cite}`klicpera2019directional` showed that you can achieve this if you do edge updates and encode the edge vectors using a rotation equivariant basis set with spherical harmonics and Bessel functions. These kind of edge updating GNNs can be used to predict protein structure {cite}`jing2020learning`.\n",

    "Another common variation on node features is to pack more into node features than just element identity. In many examples, you will see people inserting valence, elemental mass, electronegativity, a bit indicating if the atom is in a ring, a bit indicating if the atom is aromatic, etc. Typically these are unnecessary, since a model should be able to learn any of these features which are computed from the graph and node elements. However, we and others have empirically found that some can help, specifically indicating if an atom is in a ring {cite}`li2020graph`. Choosing extra features to include though should be at the bottom of your list of things to explore when designing and using GNNs."

    "### Beyond Message Passing\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the common themes of GNN research is moving \"beyond message passing,\" where message passing is the message construction, aggregation, and node update with messages. Some view this as impossible -- claiming that all GNNs can be recast as message passing {cite}`velivckovic2022message`. Another direction is on disconnecting the underlying graph being input to the GNN and the graph used to compute updates. We sort of saw this above with SchNet, where we restricted the maximum degree for the message passing. More useful are ideas like \"lifting\" the graphs into more structured objects like simplicial complexes {cite}`bodnar2021weisfeiler`. Finally, you can also choose where to send the messages beyond just neighbors {cite}`thiede2021autobahn`. For example, all nodes on a path could communicate messages or all nodes in a clique. \n",

    "It is possible to convert a graph into a string if you're working with an adjacency matrix without continuous values. Molecules specifically can be converted into a string. This means you can use layers for sequences/strings (e.g., recurrent neural networks or 1D convolutions) and avoid the complexities of a graph neural network. SMILES is one way to convert molecular graphs into strings. With SMILES, you cannot predict a per-atom quantity and thus a graph neural network is required for atom/bond labels. However, the choice is less clear for per-molecule properties like toxicity or solubility. There is no consensus about if a graph or string/SMILES representation is better. SMILES can exceed certain graph neural networks in accuracy on some tasks. SMILES is typically better on generative tasks. Graphs obviously beat SMILES in label representations, because they have granularity of bonds/edges.  We'll see how to model SMILES in {doc}`NLP`, but it is an open question of which is better.\n",

    "### Stereochemistry/Chiral Molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "Stereochemistry is fundamentally a 3D property of molecules and thus not present in the covalent bonding. It is measured experimentally by seeing if molecules rotate polarized light and a molecule is called chiral or \"optically active\" if it is experimentally known to have this property. Stereochemistry is the categorization of how molecules can preferentially rotate polarized light through asymmetries with respect to their mirror images. In organic chemistry, the majority of stereochemistry is of enantiomers. Enantiomers are \"handedness\" around specific atoms called chiral centers which have 4 or more different bonded atoms. These may be treated in a graph by indicating which nodes are chiral centers (nodes) and what their state or mixture of states (racemic) are. This can be treated as an extra processing step. Amino acids and thus all proteins are entaniomers with only one form present. This chirality of proteins means many drug molecules can be more or less potent depending on their stereochemistry. \n",

    "Adding node labels is not enough generally. Molecules can interconvert between stereoisomers at chiral centers through a process called tautomerization. There are also types of stereochemistry that are not at a specific atom, like rotamers that are around a bond. Then there is stereochemistry that involves multiple atoms like axial helecene. As shown in {numref}`helicene`, the molecule has no chiral centers but is \"optically active\" (experimentally measured to be chiral) because of its helix which can be left- or right-handed. "

    "* Molecules can be represented by graphs by using one-hot encoded feature vectors that show the elemental identity of each node (atom) and an adjacency matrix that show immediate neighbors (bonded atoms).\n",
    "* Graph neural networks are a category of deep neural networks that have graphs as inputs.\n",
    "* One of the early GNNs is the Kipf & Welling GCN. The input to the GCN is the node feature vector and the adjacency matrix, and returns the updated node feature vector. The GCN is permutation invariant because it averages over the neighbors. \n",
    "* A GCN can be viewed as a message-passing layer, in which we have senders and receivers. Messages are computed from neighboring nodes, which when aggregated update that node. \n",
    "* A gated graph neural network is a variant of the message passing layer, for which the nodes are updated according to a gated recurrent unit function. \n",
    "* The aggregation of messages is sometimes called pooling, for which there are multiple reduction operations. \n",
    "* GNNs output a graph. To get a per-atom or per-molecule property, use a readout function. The readout depends on if your property is intensive vs extensive \n",
    "* The Battaglia equations encompasses almost all GNNs into a set of 6 update and aggregation equations.\n",
    "* You can convert xyz coordinates into a graph and use a GNN like SchNet "
